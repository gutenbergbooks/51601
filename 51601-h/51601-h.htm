<h2>I<br />

<small>Preamble</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> one of the high hills that border the river
Wye, there stands an old cottage, perched on an
outstanding bluff, with apparently no way of
approach save by airship.</p>

<p>Looking up at it from the river bank by the
weir (the self-same weir beside which Wordsworth
sat when he wrote his famous “Lines”),
you can only glimpse the chimneys and angles
of the roof, so buried is the house in the trees
that clothe the hill-slopes to a height of nearly
nine hundred feet.</p>

<p>The cottage is not quite at the top of the
hill; behind it rise still more woods, making
the steeps in early spring a mist of purple and
brown and soft grey bursting buds, followed by
pale shimmering green, with frequent splashes
of white when the hundreds of wild cherries
break into bloom.</p>

<p>A darker green sweeps over all with the
oncoming of summer, which in turn becomes
crimson, lemon, rust-gold, bronze-green, copper
and orange in the autumn, where coppices of
birch and oak, ash and beech, wild cherry, crab
apple, yew and hazel intermingle with the stately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
ranks of the larch-woods that revel in the
heights, and give the hills a jagged edge against
the sky.</p>

<p>The casual tourist who merely “does” the
Wye Valley—which invariably means scorching
along the one good road the district possesses,
skirting the foot of the hills—has a clever knack
of entirely missing, as a rule, the larch-woods and
the weir. Obviously, when any self-respecting
motorist finds himself on a fine road where he
can trundle along at thirty miles an hour (at the
least), with seldom any official let or hindrance,
he naturally shows his friends what his car can
do! And in such circumstances it is necessary
to keep the eyes glued to the half-mile straight
ahead. Even though the natives are too virtuous
to need the upkeep of many policemen, stray
cattle and slow-dragging timber-wains can be
quite as upsetting as a constable; while a landslide
down the hills may precipitate huge trees
across the road any day of the year, and prove
an equal hindrance.</p>

<p>Hence, the motorist seldom seems to have
eyes to spare for anything but the road; he
takes as read the woods that climb the great
green walls towering far and yet farther above
him. And as for the many weirs he passes—who
could even hear them above the hustle of
a becomingly powerful car that is hoping to
boast how it covered the twenty-nine miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Chepstow to Ross in exactly thirty minutes!
Small wonder that such as these never see that
weather-worn cottage, half-hidden among the
green.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But for those who are too poor, or too rich,
to need to bother about advertising their car—those
who can indulge in the luxury of walking
with no fear of losing social prestige—there
is, about that cottage, a world of eternal youth
that never grows old, a world that is for ever
offering new discoveries.</p>

<p>And from the weir in the valley to the larch-woods
at the summit, curiously insistent voices
are calling. You have but to walk along the
river bank to hear them in the tumbling, swirling
waters as they pour over, and sweep around, the
boulders in the river bed. And although the
only living thing you may actually see is the
blue glint of a darting kingfisher, or a heron
standing sentinel on some mossed and water-splashed
rock, or a burnished swallow skimming
over the surface of the water, you know for a
certainty that there is more—much more—in the
murmur of the river and the clamour of the weir
than the ear can ever classify.</p>

<p>Loud as it is when the tide is going down, it
is not noisy—for noise never soothes, whereas
this babbling of the waters is one of the most
restful sounds the tired mind can know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>When you leave the river, and take the path
that climbs up through the woods—the path
you have to search for, so overgrown is it with
nut bushes and bracken and low hanging branches
of the birches—another sense of mystery awaits
you. Though the way may get easier, and the
trail a little more defined, the higher you climb,
you feel you are penetrating a new land—that
you are the first ever to come this way.</p>

<p>And that inexplicable lure of the unknown
seizes you; though you can see nothing ahead
of you but a steep rough footpath arched over
by the branches of the trees that hedge you
about on either side, you are conscious of “something”
beyond the croon of the ringdoves and the
scuttle of the rabbit. It comes to you in the
odour of last year’s dead leaves under the oaks;
in the pungent warm scent of the larches in the
sun. It greets you in the army of foxgloves
that have monopolized the one bit of open sky
space where a few trees were uprooted in a storm;
and in the tall clump of dark blue campanula
that has sprung up in another spot where a sun-shaft
falls; and in the regiments of wild daffodils
in a clearing that so far have escaped the trowel
of the spoiler.</p>

<p>You sense it on an early Easter day, when
you pause half-way up, and look back on a vast
tracery of bare branches and twigs, pale grey
where the light strikes on them, and bursting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
into smiles at intervals where the blackthorn
has come out.</p>

<p>It speaks to you when you come upon the
smooth grey bark of the beeches, the beautifully
ribbed rind of the Spanish chestnut, and the
scaly, red trunks of the pines.</p>

<p>You feel it at your feet when you see the
brown, uncurling fern fronds; and it pulls at
your heart when you step across a brook that
is quietly talking to itself, like a happy baby,
as it wanders downhill, unconcerned and most
haphazard, amid watercress and ragged robin
and creeping jenny.</p>

<p>When at last you emerge for a moment—breathless—from
the woods, and come upon the
cottage, standing in the midst of its gay flower-patch,
you think you have solved the mystery
in the sweet smell of the newly turned earth;
or that it hovers over the crimson flame of the
Herb Robert glowing all about the tops of the
grey stone walls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yet it is not merely the birds and the flowers,
the wood scents and the trees that hold one as
with a spell. Such things can be catalogued;
whereas there is something intangible among the
wild woods, something indefinable, beyond all
material things, that makes in some incomprehensible
way for peace of mind and the mending
of the soul. And it is one of our greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
blessings that we cannot tabulate it, or order
it by the dozen from the Stores; that it cannot
be “cornered” or monopolized by the money
grubber.</p>

<p>The healing of the hills cannot be purchased
with gold. It is free to all—yet it can only be
had by individual, quiet seeking.</p>

<p>The Glory still burns in the Bush; the Light
of God’s kindling can never be extinguished.
But sometimes we are too preoccupied to turn
aside to see the great sight; and sometimes we
fail to put our shoes from off our feet, forgetting
that the place whereon we stand is holy ground.</p>

<h2>II<br />

<small>Enter Eileen</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> no “at home” day. I confess it reluctantly,
knowing what a state of social forsakenness
this implies. But it is wonderful how you
can manage to occupy your time with the simple
little duties of an editor’s office, till you never
feel the lack of greater events!</p>

<p>Not that I am cut off from acquaintances
thereby; decidedly not. They are kind enough
to turn up on Saturday afternoons and take their
chance of finding me in; and when they do,
with one accord they proceed to pity me for all
the “at homes” I’ve missed during the week,
and they do their best to make me bright and
happy for the short half-holiday I am able to
take from work, while I just sit with my hands
in my lap and give myself up to being entertained.</p>

<p>I don’t do knitting on such occasions, unlike
Miss Quirker who, when I chance to call,
remarks, “You’ll excuse my going on with this
sock, won’t you?—then I shan’t feel that I’m
<i>entirely</i> wasting my time!”</p>

<p>For weeks I had been feeling that, no matter
what happened, I simply must get away from
London for a change of scene and a change of
noise—not a holiday; holidays had been out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the question for some time past, with the major
portion of the office staff at the front. We had
been postponing and postponing going away,
feeling that it was unpatriotic to be out of town
when there was so much work to do. But at
last I decided some fresh air was imperative, and
arranged to spend a little time at my cottage on
the hillside, Virginia and Ursula, my two most
intimate friends, accompanying me, as the Head
of Affairs was abroad on important business.</p>

<p>It seemed such long, long months since I
had heard anything about the Flower-Patch.
True, I had left Mrs. Widow (the villager who is
supposed to look after the house in my absence)
a bundle of stamped, addressed envelopes, when
last I was down, begging her to send me an
occasional letter, giving me news of the cottage,
and telling me how the flowers were getting on,
and whether the rose arches had blown down,
and when the wild snowdrops in the orchard
were in bloom, and if there were many apples
on the new trees we had planted, and whether
the lavender cuttings had taken hold, etc. I
felt that a few details of this description might
help to keep my brain balanced amid the tumult
and terror of the War.</p>

<p>Mrs. Widow wrote regularly every month,
and this is the type of letter she always sent:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Mam. i hope your well, my newralger
has been cruell bad but it is Better now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
my daugters baby ethel have two teeth. she is
a smart Baby but do cry a lot. Mrs Greens
little girl have had something in her throat taken
out. doctor says its had a noise. John Green
have been called up but I expec you dont know
none of them As they lives 3 mile above Monmouth.
Mrs Greens sister lives to Cardiff she
had a boy last week. i hope the master is well.
Its the Sunday School versary tomorror. Thank
you for the money. glad to say everything all
rite.</p>

<div class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 5em;">Yours</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Mrs Widow</span>.”<br />
</div></div>

<p>I suppose the correct thing would be to call
the letters “human documents”; but as the
humans mentioned in the documents are, as
often as not, people of whom I have never
heard, the record of anniversaries, illnesses,
births, deaths, and marriages that she sends
regularly each month (as a receipt for cash
received), are seldom either illuminating or
exciting. There was nothing for it but to go
down and glean impressions first hand.</p>

<p>It was known that I was going out of town
the following week, therefore a collection of
callers had looked in, and they were doing their
utmost to “liven me up” one afternoon in
February, and we were having a lovely time
explaining to each other how highly strung our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
respective doctors said we were when they insisted
that we must take a complete rest. It
appeared—after a lavish amount of detail—that
we each suffered from far too active a brain;
I found I was by no means the only one!</p>

<p>We also were most communicative about the
brilliancy of our children—not that we said it
because we were their mothers, you understand;
fortunately, unlike other mothers, we were able
to take quite detached views of our own children,
and regard them from a purely impersonal standpoint;
a great gain, because it enabled us to see
how really exceptional they were.</p>

<p>I was not expected to contribute anything
under this heading, save copious notes of exclamation
on hearing what the various head
masters and mistresses had said regarding the
genius of the respective children. It was simply
amazing to sit there and just contemplate how
indebted the world would ultimately be to these
ladies, for having bestowed such prodigies on
their day and generation; for evidently there
wasn’t one of my guests who owned a just-ordinary
child! No, these young people were
all the joy and pride of their teacher, and the
way all of them would have passed their exams,
(if they hadn’t also possessed too active brains,
like their mothers), was positively phenomenal.</p>

<p>There was one exception though—a boy at
Dulwich, who was notorious for his adhesion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the lowest place in the form. But his mother,
not one whit behind the others in her proud
estimate of her son, confided to me that, for her
part, she shouldn’t think of allowing Claude to
be high up in the form. His ability was so
marked, that the doctor said he must at all
costs be kept back. Besides, you always knew
that a school that put its brightest and most
brilliant boys at the bottom of the class never
showed favouritism or forced the children
unduly.</p>

<p>I agreed with her heartily, and then listened
to the confidences of another caller, a near neighbour
(this one was without children, brilliant or
otherwise), who told me that she had felt it her
patriotic duty in war time to do all she could
with her own two hands in the house; she had
therefore cut down her fourteen indoor servants
to nine; and she assured me she found that
they could really manage quite well with this
small number. Of course I looked politely
incredulous; who wouldn’t, knowing that there
was her husband as well as herself to be waited
upon?—and I raised my eyebrows interrogatively,
as though to inquire how she ever succeeded in
getting even the simplest war-meal served with
so inadequate a staff! But before she had
time to tell me how she managed, the door
opened and Mrs. Griggles was announced. And
as, whenever Mrs. Griggles is announced, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the signal for everyone who can to fly, I was not
surprised to see furs and handbags being collected,
and in a few more minutes the newcomer and I
had the drawing room to ourselves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Griggles is a woman with, let us say, a
dominant note; not that I object to that; every
woman nowadays simply must have a dominant
note if she is to keep her head above water
(women’s war-work has proved a boon in that
respect), and some of them are more trying than
Mrs. Griggles’ pursuit of charity recipients.
There is the moth-ball lady, for instance, who’s
perennial boast is that the moth never come
near <i>her</i> furs; the nuisance is that no one else
can come near them either.</p>

<p>Then there is the educational lady, who runs
a serial story on the iniquities of our educational
methods. “The whole system is wrong, abso-<i>lute</i>-ly
wrong, from beginning to end,” she
declaims. My one consolation is, that she
would be far less pleased if it were right, since
she would then have nothing to rail about.</p>

<p>But my greatest bugbear is the inquisitorial
lady—generally eulogized by the Vicar, when he
is stuck fast for an adjective, as “<i>very</i> capable.”
She starts right away, in the middle of a piece
of best war-cake, with a clear cut inquiry such
as: “Does your husband wear striped flannel
shirts under his white ones?” Hurriedly you
try to decide on the safest reply. But she has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
you either way! If you say Yes, she explains
how injurious it is to wear coloured stripes;
they may be a deadly skin irritant, for all you
know. If you say No, she holds up hands of
amazement that any woman can neglect the
man of her heart in such a way, and instructs
you in the necessity for his wearing flannel in
addition to his vests.</p>

<p>Mrs. Griggles is a mere picnic beside the
inquisitorial lady, for at least you know what
her theme will be; whereas with the other you
never know where she will open an attack.</p>

<p>Mrs. Griggles’ mission in life is to be generous
and charitable. “It is so beautiful to feel that
you have done another a kindness, no matter
how small,” she constantly remarks. And I’ll say
this for Mrs. Griggles, I never knew anyone able
to do so many kindnesses in the course of the
year—at other people’s expense! And I never
knew anyone more generous—with other people’s
possessions.</p>

<p>Where her own belongings are concerned,
she is the very soul of rigid economy; why they
didn’t co-opt her on to the War Savings Committee
I cannot understand.</p>

<p>Only once has she been known to give away
anything of her own, and that was a paper
pattern of a dressing jacket that she cut out in
newspaper from the tissue original which she
had borrowed from a friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever I see the lady looming in the
offing, I find myself mentally running over my
wardrobe, to see what coat or skirt I can spare
for the sad case she is probably just starting in a
hairdresser’s shop; or wondering whether I have
any sheets for a sick woman; or whether the
stock of knee-caps I purchased at the last Bazaar
is quite exhausted; or whether the kitchen
would rebel if she does send every week for the
tea-leaves; or whether I’ve given away all the
Surgical-Aid letters.</p>

<p>You never know what request she will make.
Yet she doesn’t irritate me, as she does some
people, simply because I regard her as a Charity-Broker;
her work is distinctly useful, and, up to
a certain point, praiseworthy, if she didn’t make
quite such a song about her own benevolence
and ignore the part in it played by other people.</p>

<p>She saves my time by hunting out cases that
may, or may not, need help; and if she glows
when she bestows my money or my boots upon
them—well, I glow too, with the thought of my
own kindness and beneficence. And anything
that can make anybody glow in this vale of
tears, isn’t to be despised.</p>

<p>Of course I wasn’t surprised when she began,
with her second mouthful, “By the way, dear,
I’ve <i>such</i> a distressing case I’m needing a little
help for; really quite <i>heart</i>-breaking.”</p>

<p>I’d heard it all before, and instantly decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that my mackintosh could go; it was rather too
skimpy for the fuller skirts that the season had
ushered in. Likewise the plaid blouse; the
pattern was very disappointing now it was made
up; piece goods are so deceptive. And I
would gladly part with the vermilion satin
cushion embroidered with yellow eschscholtzias,
that had lain in a trunk in the attic since the
last Sale of Work but two, if the distressing
case could be induced to believe that it needed
propping up in bed. But the rest of my goods
I meant to cling to with all the tenacity of a
war-reduced woman with no separation allowance.
I hadn’t one solitary woollen garment to
spare, no matter <i>how</i> rheumaticky the heartbreak
might be.</p>

<p>But it turned out that it wasn’t clothes she
was wanting, at least, only as a side issue. Her
main need was for a few weeks of fresh air, a
happy home, plenty of good plain food and good
influence (this last, she told me, was <i>most</i> important,
and that was why she had thought at once
of coming to me) for a girl who had just had a
bad break-down, through overwork and underfeeding
in a cheap-class boarding house where
she had been the maid of all work. Nothing
the matter with her that you could put your
finger on, but just a general slump—though
Mrs. Griggles put it more choicely than that.</p>

<p>The girl’s biographical data included: a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
grandmother who attended Mrs. Griggles’
mothers’ meeting regularly, though she had to
hobble there, one of the cleanest and most
respectful women you could ever hope to meet;
a mother who had died in the Infirmary at her
birth, a father who had never been forthcoming,
and an upbringing in the workhouse schools.</p>

<p>I hadn’t been exactly planning to take on
an orphan at that time: they are proverbial for
their appetites, and the butcher’s book hadn’t
led my thoughts in that particular direction, any
more than the dairyman’s weekly bill. All the
same, when Mrs. Griggles showed me how plain
my duty lay before me, naturally I said: “Send
her and her grandmother round to see me this
evening.” I was even more anxious to see the
grandmother than the girl; for I had long ago
given up all hope of ever meeting again such a
phenomenon (or perhaps it should be phenomena,
being feminine) as a woman who was clean as
well as respectful!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They arrived promptly. The grandmother
seemed a sensible, hard-working body, who had
migrated from Devonshire to London when she
married; for over forty years she had lived, or
rather existed, in the back-drifts of our great
city with never a glimpse of her native village.
Yet——</p>

<p>On my writing table there stood a bowl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
snowdrops, in a mass of sweet-scented frondy
moss, with sprigs of the tiny-leaved ivy; they had
arrived only that morning from the Flower-Patch
among the hills. When she saw them, the old
woman clasped her hands with genuine emotion.
“Oh, ma’am, <i>how</i> they ’mind me of when I was a
girl!” she exclaimed. “And with that moss and
all! Why, I can just feel my fingers getting all
cold and damp as they used to when I did
gather them in the lane ’long by our house—it
seems on’y yesterday, that it do!” and tears
actually came to her eyes.</p>

<p>I decided on the spot that her granddaughter
should have the freshest of air and the best of
food (to say nothing of unlimited good influence)
for the next month, at any rate.</p>

<p>As for the granddaughter herself, I think
she was the most utterly dejected, forlorn, of-no-account-looking
girl I have ever set eyes
on. She told me she was twenty (though her
intelligence seemed about fourteen), and her
name was Eileen. It was noticeable, however,
that her grandmother, in the fit of reminiscent
absent-mindedness occasioned by the snowdrops,
called her Ann.</p>

<p>It wasn’t that she looked ill; hers was an
expression of hopelessness; the look that comes
to a young thing from a course of systematic
unkindness from which it has neither the wit
nor the courage to escape. Since she had left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the Parish Schools, she had apparently drifted
from one place to another, each worse than the
last. Fortunately her grandmother had kept a
firm hold of her, and had done her best to keep
her clean—both in body and mind; but her
whole appearance said as plainly as any words,
that no one else had ever taken the slightest
personal interest in her, or given her anything to
hope for.</p>

<p>Her hair was screwed round in a small tight
knot in the nape of her neck, and kept there by
two huge hairpins the size of small meat skewers;
her dress was merely a dingy-black shapeless
covering, not even a fancy button to brighten
it; her hat was a plain all-black sailor. She
had that blank, dazed look that one so often sees
when lower-class children are brought up in
masses, where individual attention is impossible.</p>

<p>I told them that I was going down to the
West of England the following week, and if she
thought she could stand the quiet, and the
absence of shops and people, Eileen could come
for a month, and just breathe the fresh air and do
her best to get strong.</p>

<p>She was genuinely delighted—there was no
mistake about that. She seemed quite to wake
up, and became almost animated at the thought
of going into the country. <i>That</i> was the thing
that appealed to her; and she looked at me
with open-eyed amazement when I told her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that the snowdrops grew wild in the orchard
there.</p>

<p>In the orchard? And might she pick a few
for herself and send one or two to her grandmother?
Wouldn’t “they” mind if anyone
picked some? She had never seen a violet or a
primrose growing wild in her life, though she
had always wanted to.</p>

<p>And she and her grandmother looked and
smiled at each other with some new bond of
sympathy.</p>

<p>Heredity will out!</p>

<p>“But,” said the grandmother firmly, almost
ashamed of her own sentimental lapse of the
minute before, “of course she will work, ma’am,
and work well—or she’s no granddaughter of
mine!—in return for your great kindness in
having her. She can’t pay you in money, but
she can work, and I hope you’ll find her very
useful. You’ll do your best for the lady, won’t
you, Ann?”—most severely to the girl.</p>

<p>“Yes, grandmother,” she replied, dropping
back into an attitude of meek dejection. “Of
course I’ll do my <i>very</i> best.”</p>

<p>I told them there was no need for her to do
more than make her own bed. Abigail would
be there to do all I needed. But the girl
protested she should be happier if she had
proper work to do, if only I could find something
I wanted done; and her grandmother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
insisted that she hoped she knew her place, and
it wasn’t a lady she was born to be, and therefore
I must see that she didn’t sit with her hands
idle.</p>

<p>So I said she and the housemaid must settle
it between them, and I summoned Abigail to be
introduced to Eileen, and explained that they
would be spending the next week or two together.</p>

<p>Abigail listened, I presume, though her gaze
was on the curtain-pole at the far end of the
room; and she finally departed with neither look
nor word that betrayed the slightest consciousness
of Eileen’s existence; Eileen meanwhile
looked nervously frightened and more dejected
than ever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was by no means surprised when Abigail
sought me out next morning to inquire, if it was
all the same to me, might cook go down to the
country this time, in her stead? as her sister
was expecting to be married immediately—well,
it might be next week, or the week after, or
next month; she couldn’t say exactly; it all
depended on when her young man got leave.
But naturally she, Abigail, wanted to be present
at the wedding; and one couldn’t get up in
half-an-hour from Tintern! In any case, she
was having a new dress made, in readiness for
the event, and wanted to go to the dressmaker
next Friday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be a most inhuman person who
sought to part a girl and her sister’s wedding;
naturally I said on no account must she be away
from London on such an occasion—and please
send cook to me.</p>

<p>She came, with pursed lips.</p>

<p>Of course, if Madam wished her to go down
to the country, Madam had only to give instructions,
etc.—the inference being that whenever
Madam gave instructions, crowds flew to carry
them out!</p>

<p>But her left ankle had been very troublesome
lately; Madam probably remembered that
it was all due to the time she turned her foot
under on the rough path in the lower wood the
very last occasion she went down. She had
thought of asking for a couple of hours off, to go
to the doctor about it to-morrow; but of course,
if there wasn’t time for that, etc.——</p>

<p>February in the country never did agree
with her; always gave her hay fever, she was
never herself for six months after; still, if I
wished her to go next week, etc.——</p>

<p>Only, there was one point on which she
would be glad of a clear understanding before
she went: <i>was she expected to wait on that young
person?</i></p>

<p>I told her, no; and she need not wait on me
either. I shouldn’t take either of them down
with me. I left it at that—to her surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Then I sought out Eileen and her grandmother,
asked if she felt she could make the
fires and wash up, if Mrs. Widow and I did all
the rest; as, if so, I should pay her at the same
rate that I paid Abigail. You should have seen
the look of relief that came over her face when
she heard Abigail was not going.</p>

<p>“Oh, I could do <i>everything</i>,” she said. “I’d
so much rather do it and be by myself. I’m
very strong; and I’m afraid I might upset Miss
Abigail.”</p>

<p>“<i>Miss</i> Abigail!” snorted the old grandmother.
“Has to earn her living same as the
rest of us, I suppose! But I’m much more easy
in my mind, ma’am, that Ann is going without
her. She’ll look after you well, she will; you’ll
want nothing, her’ll see to that” (slipping back
into her old-time Devonshire), “but she’s not
bin used to stuck-up society.”</p>

<p>Thus it came about that instead of the
fashionably-attired and efficient Abigail, I eventually
went down to my cottage accompanied
by a girl who looked precisely like an estimable
orphan, just stepped out of some Early Victorian
Sunday-school library book; and you felt sure
she would come to an equally virtuous end.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I didn’t go the following week,
as I had planned.</p>

<h2>III<br />

<small>“You Never Know”</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">Life is full of surprises.</p>

<p>Virginia has always maintained that the
motto of my house ought to be “<small>YOU NEVER
KNOW</small>,” simply because of the rapidity with
which I change my mind, and the complications
and unexpected developments that follow thereupon.</p>

<p>She begged me to have it carved in the
wooden beams above the mantelpiece. But as
I didn’t, she brought me a Chinese tablet (her
brother is a persistent traveller, and I think she
had unearthed it from some of his effects),
bearing on a red background three imposing-looking
Chinese symbols, in gold.</p>

<p>I asked her what they meant; though I have
never embarked on any language of China,
Virginia has studied most things under the sun,
and I concluded she knew. She replied that it
was the household motto: “You never know”;
and she placed it in a conspicuous position
above the fireplace in my London dining-room.
And when guests asked its meaning, of course I
translated it for them, with the air of one who
had spoken Mandarin from her cradle; and they
looked proportionately impressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, however, an Oriental scholar of
unquestionable authority chanced to be dining
with us, and he suddenly raised his glasses and
studied the tablet with evident interest.</p>

<p>“May I ask why you have that above the
mantelpiece?” he inquired politely.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s merely the family motto,” I answered
airily, “but we have it in Chinese to-night, in
your honour.”</p>

<p>“Really! You do surprise me!! It seems
so curious to be greeted with that in your
house!!!” And he looked at me in undisguised
amazement.</p>

<p>Then I grew anxious, and wondered to
myself what it did mean; and since discretion
is the better part of a good many things, I
thought it would be wisest to explain that
I hadn’t the faintest idea what it stood for.</p>

<p>He smiled when I confessed. “Well, I can
tell you,” he said, as he proceeded to mumble a
little in an unknown tongue to himself, reading
each collection of strokes in turn. “It means—er—let
me see—well—to translate it quite
broadly, you understand, in the vernacular, the
nearest equivalent in English is ‘Beware of
Pickpockets.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Truly, you never know!</p>

<p>Work was extra heavy in my office that
week. Like every other business house, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
were understaffed, with the majority of our
expert men at the front. Moreover, I was
trying to get things a little ahead, as I was
going away on the Friday.</p>

<p>I did not get home till nearly nine o’clock
on the Tuesday following my adoption of
Eileen, and by that time I was too tired to
trouble about matters domestic. Nevertheless
I noticed that the house seemed very draughty;
but I put it down to a very high wind that had
set in earlier in the day.</p>

<p>As I was going upstairs to bed about half-past
ten, I noticed the powerful draught again.
I like plenty of air in the house, but after all a
line should be drawn somewhere when it is
blowing a hurricane, and I said so.</p>

<p>“<i>Well</i>, and to think I forgot to tell you!”
said Abigail cheerfully. “The skylight’s blown
clean away, and rain’s been pouring in like anything
on the top landing!” Judging by her
pleased expression, you might have thought that
the deluge was in gold.</p>

<p>If you have ever been fortunate enough to
find yourself minus a fair-sized skylight on a
stormy night, and the man of the house away
on urgent business, and not expected back for a
month, you will know what my feelings were
when I heard the news. It is useless for me to
try to describe them.</p>

<p>Virginia and Ursula, who live near me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
London, were hastily summoned. By the time
we had all done exclaiming, “Well, I never!”
singly and in chorus, and had heard full details of
the catastrophe repeated for the eighth time by
Abigail, it was eleven o’clock. And as no self-respecting
builder’s man can do any work after
five o’clock (and few seem able to do any before
that hour), it was obviously useless to hope for
professional aid. So we took a step-ladder to
the top landing and piled it on a table, with me
on top of all, domestics clutching the step-ladder
fervently as I balanced myself on its dizzy
height, and exclaiming, “Oh, do be careful,
madam!” at frequent intervals; with Virginia
and Ursula offering unlimited advice in a
running duet.</p>

<p>At last I was high enough to get my head
out of the space where the skylight ought to
have been, and there I saw it further down the
roof. I fished for it with the crook of an
umbrella-handle, and got it up at last, though
it threatened to blow away again every moment.
We managed to secure it by putting some
screws in the framework of the roving skylight,
and also in the woodwork to which that skylight
was supposed to be attached, but wasn’t; and
then winding copper wire round and round both
sets of screws. In this way we kept the flighty
creature anchored till the morning. I was
rather proud of the neat and effectual job<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
I had made of it, when I surveyed it from
below.</p>

<p>The builder smiled politely but pitifully
when he gazed at my efforts next day. He
then proceeded to explain to me that though, of
course, he was quite competent to refix that
skylight as it ought to be fixed (and as, indeed,
it never had been fixed since the day the house
was built), nevertheless it would be an exceedingly
awkward job. From what I could gather from
his technical conversation, and diagrams made
with a stubby bit of pencil on old envelopes
from his pocket, that skylight had been placed
in absolutely the most inaccessible part of the
whole roof; it would take all sorts of ladders, to
say nothing of scaffolding, to get anywhere near
it, etc. It would be a dangerous job, too, and of
course he must take every precaution and run no
risks. All of which I knew from past experience
was by way of letting me know that (being the
unfortunate owner of the property) I should have
the privilege of settling a nice long bill presently.</p>

<p>I did feebly suggest that rather than imperil
the lives of his most valuable-looking assistants,
he should simplify matters by dealing with the
skylight from the inside. But he only looked
at me witheringly and said, “Madam, the hinges
are outside.”</p>

<p>Naturally, I was humiliated and effectually
silenced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>When, finally, they had accomplished the
well-nigh impossible, and reached that skylight,
the builder returned to report that never, in all
his life, had he seen a roof in worse condition
than mine was. It appeared to be simply a
special providence that the whole covering to
the house had not blown clean away—or else
tumbled in on top of us! He said he just
wished I would come up and see it; he didn’t
ask anyone merely to take his word for it; there
it was for me to see; and I might believe him
when he said that if the roof needed three new
slates it needed three hundred.</p>

<p>Once again I got in a gentle word to the
effect that it was strange we had never had any
trouble with the roof, nor a drop of rain come
through; but the look of injured, virtuous
dignity he put on at the mere hint of doubt on
my part, made me hastily beg him to proceed
with the necessary work—otherwise I saw myself
sitting up another night sick-nursing a skylight!</p>

<p>The builder told me I needn’t worry about
the gentleman being away; lots of gentlemen
he was in the habit of working for were away
just now; he would superintend the work his
own self, and he went off assuring me that he
meant to make a <i>good</i> job of it.</p>

<p>Then I sent a note to Eileen, asking her kindly
to postpone packing for a few days, as I was
unavoidably detained in town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The men got on the top of the roof most
mornings at about half-past six, and apparently
started to play golf up there—judging by the
sounds overhead. But they always found it
too windy, or too wet, or too something, to stay
up there, once they had awakened the whole
household. So they invariably went away again
till about three-thirty in the afternoon—by which
time I suppose the roof was thoroughly well
aired, and it was safe for them to sit on it and
smoke a pipe or two.</p>

<p>It was a fortnight before that roof was finished.
Finally they left. And the kitchen staff grew
pensive.</p>

<p>But the very day after they had cleared their
ladders away, I saw a tiny stream oozing out of
the sodden grass in the front garden. I knew,
even before the builder returned and looked wise,
that it was a leak in the pipe leading from the
water-main.</p>

<p>The pipe-mending squad that arrived next
morning was not the same as the roof-mending
squad; but the kitchen, being quite impartial,
recovered its spirits immediately.</p>

<p>These men, evidently most competent, started
work in a business-like manner, by removing the
two sets of gates, that terminate the semi-circular
carriage drive, and blocking up the stable door
with them. Next they dug what looked like a
network of trenches for giants. They piled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the edging tiles from the beds, and the gravel
from the paths, on the front door step; they
banked up turf and more gravel under the
windows; they uprooted laurels and privet, and
the usual array of evergreens that are the only
things that will keep alive in a London front
garden, and laid them one on top of the other,
effectually barricading the tradesmen’s entrance.
And when they had made it delightfully impossible
for anyone to get either in or out of the
house, they one and all came to a halt, and leant
wearily on their picks.</p>

<p>Just then a brilliant idea seemed to strike
one of them whereby he might make himself a
still greater nuisance, and he hurriedly turned
off the water.</p>

<p>They spent the remainder of the day resting
on their tools—save when they were gallantly
passing in cans and jugs of water (borrowed from
my neighbour) to smiling Cook or Abigail at the
side door.</p>

<p>It rained hard all night, and by next morning
we had quite a spacious lake in the front garden.
The squad returned to the post of duty, and
once more disposed themselves like guardian
angels on its banks. When, in sheer exasperation,
I asked them how long they were going to
leave things like that, and the house without a
drop of water, the foreman replied, politely but
non-committally, that he couldn’t exactly say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
but the Boss was coming round to see me
shortly.</p>

<p>The builder arrived later, to inform me that
this was a most serious leak; he didn’t know
when he had seen one precisely like it before.
Of course, it was partly due to the pipe; how
any man could have called himself a plumber,
and put in such a pipe as <i>that!</i>—well, words failed
him! He himself was not a man to boast of his
own doings, but he didn’t mind telling me that
I could take up any piece of ground I liked,
where he had laid a pipe, and see the sort <i>he</i> put
underground.</p>

<p>Then it transpired that the leakage was of
such a character that he dare not proceed an
inch farther with it without calling in the water
company’s officials. Did I authorise him to do
so? Of course they would charge special fees
for “opening up the ground.” I wondered where
else they would find any to “open up” on my
premises, seeing that by this time the whole
estate was a gaping void! As I saw the turncock
and a variety of other gentlemen with gold
letters embroidered on their collars, propping
themselves up against my holly hedge, I just
said, “Oh, yes; do anything you please.”</p>

<p>And they did.</p>

<p>Some of the embroidered ones then proceeded
to dig up the whole pavement, and right out
into the middle of the road (the leak being inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the garden, close beside my front door!). It
does not take long to write about it, but I don’t
want to mislead you into thinking there was any
feverish haste about their methods. Oh, no!
theirs was the calm un-hurrying work of the
true artist; and the builder’s squad stood round
admiringly, most careful not to interfere.</p>

<p>Once again the whole lot came to a standstill,
and rested on any available implement; and
they now made a goodly crowd (I had no idea
there were so many non-khaki men still loose),
which was further supplemented by a policeman,
one or two aged men who had discarded the
workhouse for the more leisurely life that modern
business offers, and a variety of languid young
ladies who had been sent out on urgent errands
from sundry local shops.</p>

<p>In the lull, the chief official from the water
company sought an interview with me, when he
broke the news that never, in all his life, had he
seen a more antiquated stop-cock (which, by the
way, had been made in Germany) than the one
I had had placed (apparently out of sheer perversity
or malice) in the front of my premises.
It seems that there was no key in the whole of
London that would turn that stop-cock; and
when finally it had turned it, that key could not
be got out again. However, or whenever, I had
managed to evade the Eye of Authority so far
as to drop that stop-cock into the ground, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
could not think; but, at any rate, out it would
have to come again.</p>

<p>Here I managed to get in a word sideways,
and told him that the much maligned article
had been placed there by another squad of men
from the same water company (after a similar
harangue), and then duly “passed” by an
inspector only two years ago.</p>

<p>Two years ago! he exclaimed, why, <i>that</i>
inspector had been called up in the spring, and
he was no loss to the company! Not that he
(the speaker) was one to say anything against
another man’s work, but if I would just come
out and examine it for myself (it was raining
torrents, and the stop-cock was an island in a
watery waste) I would see that the whole affair
was scandalous. He was the last to utter an ill-word
about any man, more especially behind his
back, but conscientiousness compelled him to
state that the late inspector was about as fit to
be in the employ of a water company as—“as
<i>you</i> are, ma’am.” Evidently he could think of
no more hopelessly incapable specimen of
humanity.</p>

<p>Then it transpired that the real object of his
call on me was to ask whether I authorised him
to put in a new stop-cock (more special fees, of
course).</p>

<p>As I didn’t seem to be left much choice in
the matter, and I wasn’t sure whether, if I left it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in, after being told to take it out, the Defence of
the Realm couldn’t come and have me shot at
dawn, I told him he had my full permission to
put in twenty new stop-cocks if he liked; he
was at liberty to place them as a trimming outside
my garden wall, or as an edging at the kerb,
or in a fancy zigzag design around the drive—anything—everything—whatsoever
and howsoever
he pleased, so long as it enabled him, conscientiously,
<i>to turn on my water again</i>.</p>

<p>(The lady next door had already said that
while she was delighted to give me the water,
and would even throw in all the jugs and cans
she possessed, she really couldn’t spare her
coachman (aged 73) for more than half-an-hour
at each delivery, as he was the one ewe-lamb
left them, since war claimed the rest, and
would I kindly see that my kitchen limited their
conversation to that extent, and returned him,
carriage forward, within that time.)</p>

<p>The Chief Official looked at me thoughtfully
for half a moment, and then retired in silence—to
have the door-mat he had just vacated immediately
monopolised by the builder, who had
been waiting respectfully in the background.
(I say background, because I can’t think of any
other comprehensive term that signifies a couple
of narrow, wobbly, muddy planks, laid across a
well-filled moat; <i>ground</i> there was none.)</p>

<p>He congratulated me on having been let off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
by the Official so easily, and cited instances of
owners of property he knew who had been compelled
to lay miles of fresh pipes (or it seemed
to be miles, judging by the time he took to
describe it) as the result of inattention to Official
Rules and Regulations regarding Stop-cocks.
But he intimated that he had put in a good
word for me, and besought them to deal
leniently with me, “Knowing, ma’am, how
generous you and the gentleman always are.”</p>

<p>I didn’t respond to the hint.</p>

<p>Just at this point he made an opportunity to
suggest that in view of the shocking workmanship
revealed in the pipes outside, it would
certainly be wise of me to have the pipes overhauled
all through the house, because one could
never tell when one might burst without a
moment’s notice, and a flood of water ruin
everything. It would only necessitate his
taking up the floors in the dining-room and the
study and the hall and the kitchens and the
greenhouse next the house, and possibly a landing
and bath-room and dressing-room upstairs.
As it was, the pipes might be leaking terribly
under the ground-floors already, disseminating
damp and disease throughout the house (though
the servants and I were particularly healthy at
the time). There was a terrible amount of
illness about, he continued; next door to him a
little boy had whooping-cough, and the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
undertaker, a friend of his, had just told him
trade had never been better; although they
were working day and night they could hardly
manage to execute all the orders. Of course,
all this was primarily due to damp.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he pressed his ample foot
so heavily on the hall floor, that but for a stout
linoleum I feel sure he would have gone through;
then he said it looked to him very much as
though dry rot had set in there already, and
it would probably be necessary to re-floor
the hall.</p>

<p>In vain I reminded him that it had rained
without cessation—so far as my distraught
memory served me—for the past eighteen months,
hence <i>dry</i> rot would seem little short of a miracle.
But he only looked at me in that pitying way
builders do when any feminine owner of property
ventures a remark; and he next asked if I had
noticed signs of damp anywhere in the upstairs
room? After all, the upstairs pipes might be
leaking too.</p>

<p>Then I remembered, and I told him there
undoubtedly was damp upstairs, now he mentioned
it, one patch about two feet square, and
another smaller one. He was instantly alert,
said it would certainly be one of the pipes leading
from the cistern; most dangerous, too, for you
never knew when the whole cistern might be
flowing down over everything. So I took him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
up and showed him the big wet patches on a
ceiling, one dripping with a melancholy hollow
sound into a zinc bath Abigail had placed below;
they were on the ceiling directly under that
portion of the roof where his men had played
golf each morning, the cistern being in another
part of the house, and no pipes were anywhere
near.</p>

<p>He became silent, and I left him meditating,
while I went down to see Virginia, who had
come in.</p>

<p>“Ursula and I have been making plans for
you,” she began, “as you seem too distracted to
make any for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Distracted! I should think I am; so would
you be if you had the cheerful prospect of a
cistern emptying itself on top of you at any
moment—that is to say, if it ever gets full again—and
the whole of the downstairs floor to come
up, and dry-rot in the hall, and the Law down
on you because you’ve been harbouring an alien
stop-cock, and exactly a pint of water in the
house (apart from that which is coming in
through the roof, of course), and whooping-cough
and a watery grave just ahead of you, and
the undertaker too busy to bury you!”</p>

<p>“Just listen to me,” she said soothingly.
“You are probably not aware that you have got
the back of your skirt fastened somewhere about
your left hip, and the braiding that ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
down the centre in front, is just at your right
hand. Now when a woman puts on her clothes
like <i>that</i>, it’s a sure sign she needs a little rest.
Therefore I’m going to take you right off to
the cottage first thing to-morrow morning; I’ve
told Eileen to be ready; and Ursula is coming
in here to assume charge of affairs till such time
as those amiable British workmen see fit to
remove themselves.”</p>

<p>I protested that I was far too necessary to
the well-being of London to be spared at the
moment, and widespread havoc would result if
I left town at this juncture. By way of reply,
she asked if I would take some linen blouses
with me, as well as my thicker things, in case
the weather turned warmer? And then she
summoned Abigail to help her do my packing.</p>

<p>Next morning, as I was being tenderly
placed in the one and only cab our suburb
now possesses, the whole battalion of workmen,
embroidered and otherwise, paused respectfully
in the midst of further excavations and a vastly
extended scheme of earthworks they had started
upon; and I saw a look on the face of the Chief
Official that plainly said he considered they were
removing me to an asylum none too soon!</p>

<h2>IV<br />

<small>The Hill-Side Trail</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">Eileen didn’t say much on the journey, save
an occasional burst of ecstasy when she saw a
rabbit sitting up and washing its face. It was
interesting to watch the Devonshire ancestry
looking out through eyes that hitherto had seen
little but the sordid grey-brown grime of London,
but were now drinking in everything on that loveliest
of English lines—and where can you equal
the G.W.R. for beautiful scenery, combined
with such good carriage springs, such courteous
officials, and such always-attentive guards?</p>

<p>Owing to the accommodating character of
the Time Table, as re-arranged by our paternal
government, there was no Wye Valley connection,
and we had some time to wait at Chepstow.
We went into the hotel and I ordered a meal,
Eileen choosing fried ham and eggs as the
greatest flight of luxury to which her mind could
soar. I admit it was reckless extravagance for
war-time, but Virginia and I, to say nothing of
Eileen, were cold and hungry, and really one
can’t be held accountable for one’s actions under
such circumstances. It was a noble dish when
it came, enough for five people.</p>

<p>When Eileen had cleared her first helping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
she merely gazed at me with a seraphic smile,
still clutching her knife and fork. I asked if she
would like any more?</p>

<p>“No, thank you, ma’am,” she replied, in the
most polite company style. But seeing her eyes
still on the dish, I pressed her to have another
slice; I knew she would have several hours of
keen fresh air before we could get our next
meal.</p>

<p>She leant a little towards me, her knife and
fork held upright on the table the while. “Well,
it’s like this,” she said, in a loud stage whisper,
that sent a ripple over the few people who were
in the coffee room. “Does you have to pay for
it whether you eats it or not?”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Then I <i>will</i> have some more, thank you,”
and she heaved a sigh of deep contentment.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was as well Abigail didn’t come!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The drive from the station to my cottage
seemed to be through one long vista of sweet
odours.</p>

<p>Up to Monmouth the Wye is a tidal river,
and the water was rushing up, backed by a
strong wind, bringing with it, faint but unmistakable,
the salt tang of the sea, that seems all
the more delicious when it has swept over woods
and meadows and ploughed fields.</p>

<p>As we left the river bank and started the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
long uphill climb, the scent of the newly-turned
earth became more and more insistent
as one passed stray farms and cottages, where
the most was being made of the little bright
sunshine.</p>

<p>Although it was only the end of February,
the brave bit of sunshine had stirred in the
larches thoughts of coming spring, and already
there was a suspicion of the resinous odour that
is one of their many delightful characteristics.</p>

<p>But it would be impossible to name even a
fraction of the perfumes that were floating about
that day: everything in Nature had responded
to the welcome sun-warmth; and incense was
rising from myriads of leaf-buds, closely sheathed
as yet; from uncountable armies of grass blades;
from flowering moss, and uncurling ferns, and
bursting acorns; from the hundreds of thousands
of catkins swinging on the hazels; from primroses
pushing up pink stems and yellow blossoms
in sheltered corners, where they had been protected
by drifts of dead leaves. And probably
the leaves of the wild hyacinths, now an inch or
so above ground, had brought up some of the
sweet earth-scents from below; likewise the blue-green
leaves of the daffodils just poking through
the soil, and the snowdrop spears, whose white
flowers were nodding in big patches in orchards
and front gardens. And it is certain that some
early violets were hiding under their leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>It is noticeable that while the scents of
autumn are often strong and bitter, the scents
of spring are usually delicate and sweet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It seems to me that in time we town-dwellers
will lose our sense of smell! The odours that
pervade our cities are so surpassingly abominable,
that in sheer self-defence we have to “turn off
our nose,” if you know what I mean by that;
we are getting to smell as little as possible, just
as we are getting to breathe as little as possible,
owing to the vitiated air of the great crowded
centres; with the result that we seem to
be losing our power to smell sensitively and
keenly, as well as our power to breathe
deeply.</p>

<p>In town, the winds and the seasons seem only
distinguishable by the grade of one’s underwear.
Outer garments are no guide, for in December
and January one meets bare chests in the public
thoroughfares and transparent gowns indoors;
while in August, with equal suitability, we trim
a chiffon blouse with fur! (and, by the way, it is
instructive to recall the fact that it was a German
Court dressmaker who first set going the inappropriate,
vulgar, inartistic fashion of trimming frail
transparent dress materials with fur).</p>

<p>If you live in clean fresh air, however, you
know the seasons by their odours, and it is
possible to distinguish with absolute certainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the four winds of heaven by their scent, just as
at sea you can smell land, or an iceberg, before
it is anywhere within sight.</p>

<p>The scent of the east wind is entirely different
from the scent of the north wind, though both
are cold and penetrating. In the same way,
the scent of growing bracken—for instance—is
entirely different from the scent of moss. But
it takes time for the town-dweller to be able to
distinguish between the more subtle of the
thousand fragrances that Nature flings broadcast
about the countryside, so blunted is the
sense of smell by the coarse reek of dirt,
and petrol, and chemicals, and smoke, and over-breathed
poisoned atmosphere that does duty for
“air” in the modern centres of civilisation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Virginia was vowing that she could actually
smell the salmon in the river, when we entered
the village; at the same time, the fish cart that
makes a weekly tour of these hills was standing
outside the “New Inn” (dated 1724). I omitted
to draw her attention to the coincidence, because
at that moment the lady of the post-office stepped
out into the road and waved a telegram at our
approaching steed.</p>

<p>It was from the Head of Affairs, briefly
stating that he had returned home, safe and
sound, that he would soon have the little mess
cleared up, and that I need not worry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally, my inclination was to turn round
there and then, get back home as soon as possible,
and fall on his overcoat; but Virginia reminded
me that there was no train returning that day,
and if there were, we should probably only cross
one another on the road—in accordance with my
usual method of meeting people.</p>

<p>So I went on, a huge load having been lifted
from my brain. I am sufficiently out-of-date
and weak-minded to be profoundly thankful
when the Head of Affairs steps in and re-adjusts
my always-very-much-in-a-tangle affairs, and sets
them on a business-like basis again: and knowing
his capability to deal both with mind and matter,
I didn’t worry another moment, though I was
sceptical about any speedy clearing up of the
mess!</p>

<p>And because my heart was lighter, I seemed
to see so many things I had not noticed before.
In every sheltered corner shoots were showing,
and green things starting from the earth—and
every shoot set one’s mind running on ahead to
the things that were yet to be. I have heard
people deplore the fact that human nature is so
prone to anticipate events; I have been told
that the reason animals live such a placid, contented
life, is because they only concentrate on
the present. It may be so; but personally, I
wouldn’t be without my anticipations, even
though it may mean a loss of placidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The commandment is to take no <i>anxious</i>
thought for the morrow; there is nothing said
against looking ahead for happiness.</p>

<p>And a wander among our hills and along
our lanes on a mild February day, means that
in addition to the loveliness of early spring, you
sense the beauty of summer—and much more
besides.</p>

<p>Every soft, grey-green shoot on the tangled
honeysuckle stems sets you thinking of the yellow,
rosy-tinged blossoms that will fill the long
summer evenings with fragrance; every crimson
thorn and bursting leaf on the wild rose, tells of
far-flung branches that will arch the hedges and
flush them with pale-pink flowers later on; the
rosettes of foxglove leaves on the roadside banks
remind you of the bells that will be ringing all
along the lanes when summer sets in.</p>

<p>And although the fresh green of all the
courageous little things that have braved the
winds and peeped forth, is exquisite enough in
itself to satisfy that eternal craving of the
human heart for something fresh from the Hand
of God, yet the promise that each proclaims
carries one into further realms of loveliness, and
conjures up visions that can never be put down
in black and white.</p>

<p>One dimly understands how impossible was
the task St. John set himself when he tried to
describe the glimpse that was permitted him of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the City not made with hands. He wrote of
gold, and pearls, and crystal, and inexhaustible
gems—yet these are but cold, lifeless things, and
the list of them leaves us unmoved. With all
the words at his command, with all the similes
he could muster, nothing brings us so near a
conception of that vision as his indication of the
Divine understanding of poor human needs, and
the promise of a fuller, richer life, freed from
earthly disadvantages and with nothing to sever
us from God.</p>

<p>At a time like the present, when souls
innumerable are bearing silent sorrows, and the
whole earth is scarred with the iron hoof of the
Prussian beast, how much more to us than all
the radiance of topaz, jacinth, sapphire and
amethyst is the assurance—“There shall be no
more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
shall there be any more pain &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there
shall be no more curse: but the Throne of God
and of the Lamb shall be in it; and His servants
shall serve Him: and they shall see His Face.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this season of new-bursting life we, too,
catch a glimpse of the Beyond, and underlying
all our delight in the material beauty of spring,
is there not the still deeper joy arising from the
promise it brings of greater beauty yet unfulfilled—beauty
that transcends all earthly imaginings?
The heart, whether conscious of it or not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
assuredly finds comfort in the reminder of the
Resurrection that Nature whispers wheresoever
we may turn.</p>

<p>It is no mere haphazard chance that Easter
falls about the time of the blossoming of the
bare blackthorn bough.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One very satisfying feature of the landscape,
about this part of the river side, is the sight of
the cottages, yellow-washed or white, that seem
literally to nestle in the hollows on the hillside.
While crowded streets hold no charm for me,
and modern mansions leave me unmoved, there
is something very appealing about a little homestead
standing in its own bit of garden, with its
couple of beehives beside a towering sunflower,
its few gnarled apple trees, its cow and hayrick
maybe, if there is a bit of pasture land about the
cottage that has been redeemed by the hardest
of labour from the rocky hillside, its fowls
clucking about on the fringe of the small
holding, its wood pile, its cabbages and marrows
and rhubarb and black currants, all according to
the season, its hedge draped with washing—too
white ever to have come into touch with that
modern improvement the steam laundry. In
looking at all this, you are looking for the most
part at the total worldly wealth of the cottager,
wealth, too, that has often been acquired by the
genuine sweat of his (and her) brow. It may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
not seem much to you when you run your eye
over it; but it speaks of home in a way that no
city dwelling has ever yet attained to. Here is
not merely shelter, or just a place wherein to
spend the night; it is the very centre of life to
the inmates; the major portion of their food is
either growing in, or running about, the garden.
The side of bacon on the rack in the kitchen
came from their own pigsty; the potatoes, the
onions, the swedes in the outhouse grew from
their own planting; the big yellow vegetable
marrows hanging up in the kitchen, and the pots
of black currant and plum jam in the cupboard,
originated in their garden. The little plot is
endeared to them because it provides them with
the necessities of life, and the dwellers in the
cottages live very close to the fundamental
things that really matter, even though they may
lack some of the items that over-civilization has
ticketed the refinements of life.</p>

<p>And after a winter in town spent in a stern
wrestle for coal, potatoes, butter and milk and
bacon and many of the other necessities of life,
it is bliss indeed to land in this haven of sufficiency,
where queues are unknown, and where
the cow and the hen do their duty in life each
according to her station, and the garden and the
forests do much of the rest!</p>

<p>Even then, one has not gone to the root of
the matter. Many of these cottages are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
ancestral homes of the people who live in them,
homes that were literally wrested from the hillside
by the forefathers of those who are now
living in them. And in such cases the roots go
far deeper than the surface soil. An ancestral
home, no matter how small, can mean more to
the inmates than the most gorgeous pile that
the newly-rich millionaire can raise.</p>

<p>And to my mind, by no means the least of
the many hideous sins for which the Germans
will ultimately be called to account at the
world’s Bar of Justice, will be the violation of
the homes, the landmarks, and the ancient birthrights
of unoffending peoples, while they themselves
sat smug and sanctimonious under their
own vines and fig trees, self-complacent in the
knowledge that they were protected from
deserved retribution by their devil-driven guns.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When at last we reached the little white
gate, leading into the cottage garden, we stood
for a moment, as we always do, and looked at
the peak beyond peak, and the deep lying
valleys.</p>

<p>Sloping away from our very feet were our
own orchards and coppices, the bright lichen on
the twisted old apple trees showing almost a
blue-green against the purple of the bare birch
tree branches still lower down.</p>

<p>The sun was dropping behind the larches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
that ridged the opposite hills. Birds everywhere
were explaining to each other that they must—they
really <i>must</i>—set about house-hunting the
very first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Out in the lane, the mountain spring was
over-full and singing a riotous song of jubilation
as it tumbled out of the little wooden trough
into the pool below, and tore away down into
the valley.</p>

<p>“It’s a marvellous world,” said Virginia as
we gazed at the vast panorama that stretched
before us; and then she added, “Do you know,
I’ve come to the conclusion that I prefer a
spring of water outside the gate to all the stop-cocks
and water-mains in the world.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next morning a letter from the Head of
Affairs skipped airily over the episode of his
meeting with the builder, concentrating on the
point that I was to stay where I was, as he
would join me in a few days. But Ursula
supplied the missing details.</p>

<p>“After I saw you off at Paddington,” she
wrote, “I hurried back as fast as I could; I felt
that I should at least like to see if the four
outside walls remained of what was once your
happy home. Because, though we didn’t let
you know, the builder confided to me, as you
were leaving, that he had discovered the whole
front of the house was in a most shocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
condition, necessitating prompt ‘shoring-up’
(whatever that may mean), and requiring to be
underpinned immediately. But by the time I
reached the place where your gates ought to have
been—but weren’t—I found the Head of Affairs
(he’d sent a wire as soon as he landed in
England, but it evidently never reached you)
bestowing as much gratuitous eloquence on the
builder and the Water Company as would have
run an election. What did he say? Why,
everything that is in the English language, and
in a hundred different keys! Sometimes he
singled out some separate ‘official,’ and gave it
him, personally, in considerable detail.</p>

<p>“His analysis of the private character of the
builder was nothing short of an epic; and as for
the turncock!—what he said about turncocks
was a revelation to an unsuspecting ratepayer
like myself—No, it might be as well not to
repeat it; but I feel sure that turncock won’t
call, with a long double knock, for a Christmas-box
next December. Indeed, his remarks on
the mental capacity of every single person
employed by the Water Company lead me to
think that your family won’t be really popular
with the Metropolitan Water Board for some
time to come!</p>

<p>“And then, when he had said everything
that could possibly be said about each man
standing there, and about water and pipes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
stop-cocks and gravel and pavement and suchlike
things, he announced his intention of going on
the roof to inspect where the builder proposed
to put the pile of new slates.</p>

<p>“Now it’s a funny thing, but that builder was
not nearly so pressing that he should go up and
see for himself, as he was when talking to you.
But he insisted, and once up, he started all over
again, and made such forceful comments on the
subject of slates—and more especially the men
who put on the slates—that I was afraid they
would come through the roof.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think I ever saw a more
wilted-looking blossom than that builder when
he was finally had inside and given his marching
orders. Even before the two had descended
from the roof, the embroidered men were
hurriedly toppling the earth back into the
trenches. I believe they’ve had twenty-four
hours allowed them to get things put to rights
again. And I think they will hurry, for they
don’t seem anxious for more of the master’s
society than is absolutely necessary. At any
rate, he seemed quite able to manage matters
without any assistance from me, and so I left it
in his hands, and I’m coming down by the
next train.”</p>

<h2>V<br />

<small>Just Outside the
Back-Door</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">There is one spot in the Flower-Patch that is
loved by grown-ups as well as birds. It is the
little grotto that is just outside the cottage back-door.
It has made itself by making the best of
circumstances. Can I describe it so that you
will see it, I wonder?</p>

<p>First there comes a narrow garden bed,
full of old-fashioned flowers—Bee-balm, Jacob’s
Ladder, and Solomon’s Seal; then a rough stone
wall about two feet high keeps the earth above
from tumbling down on to the narrow bed below.
The whole of the garden being on a steeply
sloping hillside, the earth has to be propped up
at intervals by these lovely little ranks of natural
rockery, planted by Nature with hart’s-tongue
and a variety of other little ferns, with mother-of-millions
and creeping ivy, with stone-crop and
house-leeks. How <i>do</i> the things get there? How
do they plant themselves? Isn’t it marvellous
this unending gardening of Nature!</p>

<p>On a level with the top of the low wall is
another garden bed. You see the ground is rising,
rising up to the clouds all the time at the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of the cottage, just as it is falling, falling down
to the river in the valley all the time in front of
the cottage. This next terrace bed loses itself
entirely in a miniature wild wood and drops
down into a tiny dell, just big enough for a
couple of small children to give a tea-party to
the fairies in.</p>

<p>Here it is that the beauty of the whole place
seems to climax. The other side of the dell is
bounded by a large grey boulder, about six feet
high, flanked by a few smaller ones tumbling
about at various angles. The stone was too big
for the original gardener to move, so he wisely
left it where it was. They often do that on
these hills. I know one cottage that has a most
substantial stone table in the centre of the
kitchen. It is just a huge stone that was too
big to move by ordinary methods when they
erected the cottage, and so they simply left it,
and built the kitchen round it.</p>

<p>But my boulder in the grotto is not so much
for use as for beauty. True, it supports a plum
tree that springs up from behind it, just outside
the orchard rails. But the way Nature has
festooned that rock is worth going a long way
to study. From the ground at one side springs
a wild rose with stout stems that grow fairly
straight and erect, considering it is a wild rose,
and this sends out long curved and arched sprays,
dotted with pink blossoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>At the other side is a yellow jasmine, evidently
a stray from the garden.</p>

<p>The stone itself is thickly covered with moss,
small-leaved ivy (and isn’t small-leaved ivy lovely
in its colouring very often, in the early months
of the year, some brown and yellow, some red
and green?) and little ferns, till scarcely a trace
of the grey stone can be seen, and where it does
push through it is splashed with milky-green
lichen.</p>

<p>Then wandering over all is a wealth of honeysuckle
that catches hold of everything impartially,
and twines itself in all directions. At the base
of the precipitous boulder the grass is thick and
green; violets, the big purple-blue scented sort,
cluster all around the corners, and hold up rich-looking
blossoms; primroses laugh out in the
sunshine; snowdrops dingle their bells to a
delightful melody, if only our ears were more
delicately tuned to catch the music; daffodils
blow their own trumpets above their clumps of
blue-green leaves; the ground-ivy creeps and
creeps and lights up the green with its lovely
blue flowers that have never received half the
praise that is their due. And in a damp spot
there is a mass of blue forget-me-nots, with one
clump that is pure white.</p>

<p>Large ferns send up giant fronds to make
cool shadows at one end. Tiny ferns busy themselves
with the decoration of odd corners. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
hazel bush reaches over and joins hands with the
plum tree, to form a fitting roof to so lovely a
dell; as I write—in February—it is a mass of
fluttering catkins, and the plum tree is talking
about shaking out a few flowers. But without
these the place is already full of blossoms.</p>

<p>In a month or six weeks the old trees in the
orchard behind will be like bouquets of pink and
white blossoms.</p>

<p>You approach the grotto by a tiny path,
about wide enough for a child; the entrance to
the path is marked by a stunted old bush of
lavender at one side, and a grey-green clump of
sage at the other. They stand, with stems
twisted and rugged like gnomes, guarding the
entrance to the fairy’s playground; but if you
rub them the right way they send up a lovely
fragrance, and then you know you are admitted
to the freedom of the enchanted spot.</p>

<p>It is so sheltered in this corner, and protected
from the cold winds by the high hill behind, that
even the ferns from last year are green and
fresh-looking, you would think there had not
been any winter here. And the brambles that
clamber over the orchard rail—assuring the world
at large that they are a highly respectable
orchard-grown fruit tree, and not a wild weed—are
still green and crimson and a rich purple
with the lovely tints of last autumn.</p>

<p>The birds are fond of this grotto, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
wild things have found it out. Last summer,
when the boulder seemed to be dripping with
large juicy crimson honeysuckle berries, I watched
a big bullfinch gorging to his heart’s content, his
red waistcoat mingling well with the red of the
berries. Mrs. Bullfinch was also there, in her
less obtrusive grey and browny-black dress, and
she had a couple of youngsters too. But do
you think the father had any intention of sharing
the delicacies? Not a bit of it! Every time
his wife approached from the rear surreptitiously
to snatch a berry, he turned round and drove
her off (I really could have pardoned her if she
had joined the suffragettes on the spot). She
ranged her family along the orchard rail just
above, and made various attempts to forage for
them. But it was no use. So she took up her
position beside the family on the rail and waited
patiently, making plaintive sounds the while,
till Mr. Bully had stuffed to repletion and flew
away. I was glad there were a few hundred
berries still left for the family. And didn’t they
have a good time!</p>

<p>Just now the blue tits are very busy about
the fruit trees, and a robin comes out from somewhere
in the grotto at unexpected moments and
stands motionless on a stone, with a bright eye
cocked up inquiringly at the human intruder.
I fancy he has chosen it for his summer residence.</p>

<p>A squirrel is very attached to this part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the garden. Sometimes one sees him, when the
nuts are ripe, scurrying along the orchard rail in
ever such a hurry, his chestnut-red tail bigger
than himself. There are specially good nuts on
that hazel-tree.</p>

<p>This morning I went out of the back-door,
to find a large rabbit sitting and sunning himself
at his ease among the snowdrops and violets in
the little dell—within a yard of the door.</p>

<p>The weather has been like April to-day,
brilliant sunshine and heavy showers. Suddenly
the sky behind the cottage was lit up with a
rainbow—a glorious span of colour that seemed
to be resting on the hill-top. Then it dropped
a bit lower at one end, and the big pine trees
that stand higher up at the top of the orchard
looked most majestic against it. Lower it
seemed to drop, and then I distinctly saw the
place where it touched the ground. You know
they say there is a pot of gold buried at the end
of the rainbow—where do you think that rainbow
pointed? Why, straight at my fairy dell!
So I know there is gold buried under that
boulder, and that is why there is always sunshine
peeping through the green; first it comes out in
the yellow jasmine, then it flares in the daffodils,
later you find it in the dancing buttercups and
in the lovely honeysuckle, finally it waves to
you a bright “Good-bye, Summer,” in the clump
of golden-rod that is near the entrance.</p>

<h2>VI<br />

<small>Dwellers in the
Flower-Patch</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">February on our hills may be anything—from
September round to May. Sometimes it is
mild and sunny and sweet with the scent of
newly-turned earth; or it may be bitingly cold,
and very bleak in the exposed parts, with a
shivery-ness even in the valleys. You just take
your chance, sure, at least, of fresh air, peace—and
the birds.</p>

<p>That is one of the perennial joys of the place;
summer or winter you know there will be a host
of little fluttering things all ready to welcome
you as a friend, if you will but show the least
bit of friendliness towards them.</p>

<p>Not that their greeting is entirely cordial
when you arrive. The starlings are probably
the first to see you; they are arrant busybodies,
and seem to spend most of their time retailing
gossip from the ridge of the red-tiled roof. No
wonder their nests are the lazy make-shifts
they are!</p>

<p>A perfect scandal to the bird world, Mrs.
Missel-Thrush has told me; it’s a wonder the
sanitary authorities don’t insist on their being
pulled down and rebuilt! Anything, stuffed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
anywhere; a handful of straw in the chimney;
dried grass and oddments of rubbish collected in
a corner under the tiles; you wouldn’t think any
self-respecting egg would consent to be hatched
out in such a nest!—certainly no young thrush
would put up with so disreputable a nursery.
But then, as we all know, the thrushes come of
very good family; whereas the starlings!—well—not
that one would say a word against one’s
neighbours, but since everyone can see and hear
it for themselves, the starlings are simply
“impossible.”</p>

<p>But the starlings don’t seem to be the least
bit worried by the cold shoulder of the more
exclusive residents; they gabble and bawl the
whole day long, from the top of the roof, while
the one who has managed to secure the apex of
the weathercock is positively insulting. And
the moment we turn into the little white gate,
they begin.</p>

<p>“See who’s down there? I say, everybody,
look! There’s that wretched white dog again!
Remember what a perfect nuisance he was last
August, when we’d just got the youngsters out
of the nest? We were afraid every moment
lest he would start to climb the trees like their
old cat used to. Hi! there, you on the barn-roof!
Have you heard the news?” Shriek,
shriek! chatter, chatter, chatter! So they go
on for hours at a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Then policeman-robin arrives. “What’s all
this noise about?” he demands, from the post of
the gate leading into the upper orchard. “Oh,
good gracious! it’s that horrid white dog again!
Nearly shoved his nose right into our nest in the
woodruff bank last year! Chit! chit! chit!
But don’t you worry, my dear” (this to the lady
he has just married); “I’ll drive him away; you
can trust to me,” and he flicks his conceited
little tail, and flies to the top of a tree stump
near by, still calling out his “Chit! chit! chit!”
in severe reprimand.</p>

<p>Next the blackbird, hunting for a little fresh
meat among the grey, mossed-over stones that
edge the garden beds, raises his head and cranes
his neck above the overhanging heart’s-ease
trails, and the foliage of the pinks, to see what
the commotion is all about.</p>

<p>“I say, Martha!” (to the demure body in
brown, who has been meekly tracking along
behind him), “there’s that terror of a dog again!
Recollect when he was here last year? Never a
chance to enjoy a snail in peace; before you’d
given the shell more than one tap on the stone,
down he’d rush. Here he comes now! Slip
along quick to the laurels. I say, that was a
near shave! Chut! chut! chut! Go away!
What business have you to come here disturbing
respectable old inhabitants like us?”</p>

<p>And so the hubbub continues, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
small white dog with the brown ears trots in a
business-like manner all over the place, making
sure that every corner-stone, and bush, and
gate-post is just where he left it last time. And
having ascertained that the universe is still
intact, he sets off to a particular spot in the
lower orchard, sniffs about till he finds the identical
tuft of grass he is searching for; whereupon
he eats, and eats, at the long green blades, much
in the same way as we fall on the young lettuces,
or the black currants, or whatever else may be
in season when we come down. Though why
this particular tuft of grass should be the only
one he selects out of the acres and acres at his
disposal, is always a mystery to us. Yet he
never forgets it; straight for that small patch in
the middle of the big orchard he makes, once he
has done his tour of inspection round the estate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before I have been in the house half-an-hour,
I start making overtures to the birds, and they
immediately respond. I proceed by way of the
bird-board.</p>

<p>This may need explanation.</p>

<p>Outside one of the living-room windows I
have established a board that projects about a
foot beyond the wide window-ledge. At first I
had it resting on the window-ledge, but I found
that the birds were down out of sight, when
they came up to feed, hidden by the sash and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
window-frame. Therefore I had it raised to
bring it exactly on a level with the glass. It
is fixed securely on supports, so that it won’t
blow away, neither would a flock of jays and
wood-pigeons overbalance it. A couple of stout
bits of tree branches have been fixed upright at
the sides; these are very popular, as they make
the board look less bare, more tree-like and
familiar to the birds. They love to alight on
a branch, before going down to feed, and they
often return to the branch when they have eaten
their fill, saucing their relations and daring them
to touch a morsel of the food, which each bird
seems to consider its own exclusive property!
Strips of narrow lath have been nailed to the
outside edges of the board, projecting about
an inch above the level of the board. This
wooden rim saves the food from rolling off, or
blowing away too easily; it also gives the birds
a little perch that they love to stand on while
they run their eyes over the menu.</p>

<p>On this board—in times of plenty—go
crumbs, seed, rolled oats, maize, peas, little bits
of fat or suet, anything in fact that birds will
eat; and if the weather be cold, a lump of suet
will be lashed to each branch, for the tits to
peck at, with occasional bunches of bacon rind,
hanging like tassels.</p>

<p>In war-time the birds just have to take what
they can get.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours of our arrival, the
birds have re-discovered their food board, and
over they come, from garden and adjoining
orchards and woods, with such a whirring of
wings, directly they hear the window being
opened. In the apple tree, in the laburnum tree,
in the damson tree they wait, and the moment I
move away from the window, down they pounce,
and such a squabbling and chatter and succession
of arguments takes place. In a few days’
time, as they get more used to me, they flutter
down before I have even spread out their meal,
perching on the edge of the board and eyeing
me with the most audacious nerve. The robin
is positively impudent in his demand that I
should hurry up!</p>

<p>And it is not longer than a week before they
come hopping right into the room, hunting all
over the breakfast table if the window be left
open, and I have not been down sufficiently
early to meet their requirements. If the days
are cold, and outside food scarce, they tap the
window sharply with their beaks, to call attention
to their needs, while plaintive, appealing little
faces look anxiously at me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And oh, they are such a pretty little crowd.
One has no idea what clear, beautifully bright
colour our British birds can show, unless one
has seen them right away from the taint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
smoke and grime. Town environments, be they
ever so rural, are always reminiscent of the
chimneys in the distance, or the railways that
cut them up. But on these hills, where cottage
chimneys are very few and far between, and
what smoke there is, is usually wood smoke,
some of the birds are exceedingly lovely.</p>

<p>There is the great-tit, brilliantly yellow as a
daffodil, with an admixture of black velvet and
pure white; he and his wife quite take your
breath away as they splash down, out of space,
and flitter about among the sober thrushes and
darker blackbirds. And when, in the summer,
they bring their babies along with them, I
don’t think there is a prettier sight in creation
than the little bluey-grey balls of fluff, that
peck daintily at the bits of suet, and then hiss
vigorously and scold at the big wasps that come
and steal it from under their very beaks! So
tame and innocent of fear they are, that they
come into the room whenever the window is left
open; and mother and father follow them, quite
as trustfully.</p>

<p>Then again, we all think we know the blue-tit;
but when you see him in the wilds he is a
very different-looking morsel from the dirty-blue
apology you meet nearer town. On the
bird-board, he is almost metallic in the brightness
of his blue-green feathers, and the lovely
tint of yellow. He raises his crest feathers, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
pleasure, when he sees the suet on the branch;
and over the little acrobat goes, hanging head
downwards or clinging with one tiny claw to a
piece of twig; it is all one to him, he swings
about like a bright enamel pendant.</p>

<p>The male chaffinch is another very gay little
fellow, with his warm red and pretty blue and
yellow. He calls “Spink, spink,” in clear
penetrating notes, as he lands on the board; and
up comes his wife—one of the most shapely and
elegant of all the small birds, with the dearest
little face!</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bullfinch invariably come
together, unless she is detained at home with the
family. They perch on the edge of the drinking
saucer, side by side, like a pair of solemn
paroquets; he, very beautiful in crimson and
black velvet; she, decidedly more homely and
nondescript.</p>

<p>But I can’t go through the whole list, there
is such a crowd—including a little flock of eight
goldfinches that for two winters have always
been about the garden together.</p>

<p>Jays, with their handsome wing feathers and
ugly, very ugly, mouths, swoop down continually,
scaring the small birds to vanishing point, and
gobbling up the food by the shovelful! Magpies
in plenty perch on the garden rails, but only
once has one come to the board when I have
been there, and then he got his tail so mixed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with the decorative branches, that he had the
fright of his life, and never repeated the
adventure.</p>

<p>Wood pigeons are regular in their attendance,
when other food is scarce. Oh, certainly, I
know all that is to be said on the subject of
encouraging wood pigeons! But—have you
ever studied the peacock and wine-colour gleam
on their necks, when unsmirched by smoke or
grime? If so, you will understand my admiration
for them. And, in any case, ours isn’t a
farming area; there is no corn here for them to
squander, and although they sigh all summer
long, in the fir trees, “Take <i>two</i> pears, Tommy!
Take <i>two</i> pears, Tommy!—<i>do!</i>” there are very
few pears available that Tommy would even look
at; most that grow in the orchards around are
the harsh, bitter variety, used for making the
drink known as “perry” (the pear equivalent of
apple cider).</p>

<p>The wood pigeons have helped me back to
health and strength many a time, with their soft
crooning in the larches, and their quiet talk of
things above the petty strife and noisy clamour
of the struggling market place. Therefore, I
don’t say them nay, in times of plenty, if I have
a little to spare, and they chance to need it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of all the bird family, however, I think the
coal-tits are our favourites—and there are <i>such</i> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
quantity of them. Coal-tits always abound in
the neighbourhood of larch woods and birches,
which accounts for the numbers that dart about
my garden; there are birch woods lower down
the hill below the cottage, as well as the larch
woods up above; and both birch and larch
cluster thick down one side of the house to
shield it from the cold winds.</p>

<p>Though the coal-tit is not brightly-coloured,
like its relations, there is something very
delightful about his soft grey garb, and his
black head with its light grey or nearly white
streak down the back. Like the robin, he
always looks well-tailored, not a feather out of
place, not a draggled filament anywhere. And
he is so extraordinarily alert; he doesn’t seem to
give himself time to fly, he darts and dives and
flits all over the place, and seems to have an
appetite proportionately equal to that of the
proverbial alderman.</p>

<p>Down he dives the minute the food appears.
He stands very erect on his slim little legs (no
squatting down on his breast bone, as the
sparrows and even the chaffinches often do);
he cocks his head from side to side, promptly
decides on the largest lump of fat he can find;
seizes it, and flies up into a big fir tree, where,
apparently, he bolts the whole lump instantaneously!
At any rate, before you have time
to see where he alighted, down he dives, seizes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
another big piece, and off he goes again. He
seems to eat twice his own size in suet in a few
minutes! But I conclude he must drop some
of it, though I’ve never been able to prove it.
And the theory of a nestful of hungry beaks
doesn’t always explain his voraciousness; for he
disposes of just as much in the winter as in
nesting time.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of his appetite, we love him, for
he is so tiny and so wonderfully alert; one
marvels how so much energy can be boxed up
in such a small body.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Visitors who have never had much to do
with birds at close quarters—and the birds may
be said to be part of the family at this cottage,
for they live with us and meal with us—are
usually surprised at the differences and the
distinctiveness of their various personalities.</p>

<p>The robin not only adopts you at once, but
he proceeds to supervise your every action, and
instals himself as your personal attendant.
Probably this is all the more emphasized by the
fact that he will not allow any rival to encroach
on his particular territory. Most birds seem to
peg out a claim at the beginning of the season,
and to resent, more or less, the intrusion of any
other of its own kind. Swallows and sparrows
and rooks, and a few others, build in colonies,
but the majority of birds seem to prefer a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
domain each to himself, wife and family, and
you will find one pair of blackbirds driving
another from the laurel bush they have chosen,
or chasing strangers from the particular garden
path they call their own.</p>

<p>Though starlings feed—and chatter—in flocks,
one particular pair of starlings make it their
business to oust any other starling that they find
on the bird board.</p>

<p>But the robin can be a perfect terror in the
way he seeks to domineer over the whole earth.
It is a very large area that he marks off for his
individual own, and woe betide any other robin
who tries to defy him—unless he be the stronger
of the two. One of our robins killed his own
wife (we conclude, as she disappeared, after a
series of thrashings he gave her daily!), and then
he injured the wing of one of his own youngsters,
because we had petted them, and given them
food inside the living room.</p>

<p>The father used to hide behind a stone down
on the garden bed, and watch as his family—the
mother and two babies—nervously and timidly
approached the bird-board, looking round
anxiously lest father should see! Then, when
they started to feed, he would hiss out the
dreadfullest of wicked words at them, and fling
himself on them, bashing them with his beak—a
positive little fury.</p>

<p>So one day I put some food on the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
inside the room, and the down-trodden ones
hopped in. I shut the window before the irate
father could follow them. He seemed demented
with rage, when he saw them feeding and
couldn’t get at them; he literally stamped his
foot, and viciously tossed off all the pieces of
food that were on the board, flinging them to
the ground in a most highly-glazed specimen of
temper!</p>

<p>I let the family out by a side window,
instead of the bird-board window, and they
evaded their loving and affectionate relative for
a little while. But he found them at last; and
went for his wife, while the children cheeped
forlornly among the pansies in the border. We
never saw her again, poor, plucky little soul;
and one of the youngsters dragged a broken
wing along the path next day, explaining to me,
pitifully, that he couldn’t possibly get up to the
bird-board now, neither could he find mother
anywhere.</p>

<p>I took him in, and tried to save his life—but
it was no use. With all our knowledge and
skill and discoveries and training, what clumsy,
inadequate creatures we are in comparison with
a little mother bird!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Less harrowing was the incident of a robin
who, on one occasion, came inside, in order to
get more than his share of provender if possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
when he was suddenly startled by the dog
running into the room. Instead of flying
through the window that was open, he made
for a closed one, banging his head with such
force against the glass that the blow stunned
him, and he fell senseless to the ground.</p>

<p>I picked him up, and tried all the restoratives
I could think of, a drop of water on his beak, a
cold splash on his head, but to no purpose; he
lay, just a tiny handful of beautiful feathers, in
my hand; so light, so helpless, so altogether
pathetic—it hurt me badly to gaze at the small
mite that only the minute before had been
talking to me, and cheeking me, and liking me
(yes, I am sure he did), and I unable now to do
a thing to bring back the gaiety and life and
sparkle to the poor still body.</p>

<p>I felt sure he was dead, yet to give him every
chance, I placed him in a nest of soft flannel
out on the window-ledge; the day was warm,
but there was a breeze that might perhaps revive
him. And as a last offering—one does so try to
do all one can!—I put a tempting piece of suet
near his inanimate beak. And how unnatural it
seemed to see that suet remain untouched in his
vicinity!</p>

<p>I took my work and sat where I could see
if he so much as stirred a claw. But for a
quarter of an hour there wasn’t the slightest
sign of movement, except when the wind gently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
ruffled his feathers—and how exquisite they
were, the blue so unlike the ordinary blue, the
red much more red than the London robins, and
the bronze-brown so glinting.</p>

<p>At last I decided it was useless to watch any
longer, for his eyelids had never so much as
flickered.</p>

<p>I was folding up my work, when a big
yellow tit flew on to the window ledge, hopped
over inquiringly to the suet, and started to
sample it. In an instant up jumped the corpse,
and with an angry “Chit! chit!” hurled himself
at the interloper; and the last I saw of him
was chasing the yellow tit all across the garden.</p>

<p>Don’t ask me to explain; I am only telling
you what happened under my own eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yes, robin <i>père</i> can be a villain; he also can
be the extreme reverse. Like the majority of
the rest of us, he shows to the most amiable
advantage when there is no rival to distract
public admiration. So long as he is the centre,
as well as the beginning and the end, of the bird
universe, he is sweetness itself.</p>

<p>No other bird is so keenly alive to all my
comings and goings. It doesn’t matter how
fully occupied he may be with the settlement of
every other bird’s affairs, I have but to go up
the garden with fork or spade or broom, and
before I have turned half-a-dozen clods, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
pulled out a handful of weeds, I am conscious of
a soft streak through the air, though I hardly
see it; there he sits on a low branch of a currant
bush close to my hand, or stands motionless on
an edging stone at my very feet. If I take no
notice of him, in all probability he starts a
Whisper Song to call attention to himself.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard this? It suggests
nothing so much as elf-land music; I know no
song exactly like it. You seem to hear a bird
warbling most delightfully, but it is far, far
away. You raise your eyes, and scan the trees
around, but no singing bird can you discover;
you decide it must be farther off—but what a
haunting charm there is about it.</p>

<p>Then it ceases. Mr. Robin is hoping that
you have understood what he has been saying.
But no, the obtuse human just goes on weeding
the path as before; so the Whisper Song starts
again. This time you think it resembles a very
mellow musical box shut up in some distant
room.</p>

<p>Suddenly you see him, singing straight at
you, so close to your hand that it gives you quite
an uncanny feeling for the moment; and you
wonder: Who is he—what is he—that he should
be saying all this to me, obviously to me, and to
no one else but me?</p>

<p>Robin doesn’t encourage you in daydreams,
however, he means business; and once he sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that he has secured your undivided attention, he
discards the Whisper Song and comes to the
point. Down on to the path he drops, seizes an
unwary worm that your energy has brought to
light; then tosses it over scornfully and flirts a
contemptuous tail, which says as plainly as any
tale that was ever told, “Is <i>that</i> the best worm
you can offer a gentleman? Pouf!”</p>

<p>He eats it nevertheless.</p>

<p>And so he follows me round the place; I
never garden alone. If at first I cannot see
him, I whistle a quiet call; invariably I hear the
Whisper Song in response, and there he is—waiting,
watching, missing nothing, with his
tiny throat feathers vibrating and quivering as
he strives to let me into bird-land secrets, and
tells me lots and lots of wonderful things that as
yet I am too dull-witted to understand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then there are the blackbirds—for individuality
they are hard to beat; though I admit they
are always reproving someone or something, with
their “Chutter, chut, chut!”</p>

<p>I never knew a bird with as many grudges
and grievances as Augustus seems to have. He
“chut-chuts” at me if I’m late with his breakfast,
at Abigail when she ventures to gather a
few raspberries, at the dog whenever he sees
him, at the little colt for scampering down the
meadow, at the cuckoo when his voice breaks—I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
heard him get up after all the family had
gone to bed, and roundly abuse a poor July
cuckoo who had developed a bad stutter—and
every night about sundown he admonishes the
world in general, from his pulpit in a pine,
despite the fact that Martha has put the children
to bed and is trying to get them to sleep, and
that every other masculine blackbird for acres
round is discoursing on the same subject.</p>

<p>But the poor thing has had his troubles.
The first time we really distinguished Augustus
and Martha (who monopolise my bedroom
window ledge, and the pinks and pansy border)
from Claude and Juliet (who patronise the
biggest mountain ash, and consider the white
and red currants and the snails in the snapdragon
bed their particular perquisites) was
when the former (that means Augustus and
Martha, you know) built in the old plum tree
that hangs partly over the green and gold
grotto. Though it has plenty of snowy-white
flowers on its dark stems in the spring, it has
been too neglected to produce much fruit;
but it makes up in flowering ivy and heavenly-scented
honeysuckle for any other deficiencies.
And it was in this tangled mass of loveliness
that Augustus and Martha first set up housekeeping.
(Augustus being always recognizable
by reason of one grey feather.)</p>

<p>They chose it with much circumspection—Martha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
with an eye to the easy building
facilities offered by strands of tough woodbine,
and sturdy ivy cables, combined with stout
plum branches; Augustus with his main eye
focussed on the bird-board, and the other on the
accessibility of the bird-bath (originally a sheep-trough
hollowed out of a block of rough stone,
over which moss and small ivy are now trailing).</p>

<p>Altogether it was a most desirable site for a
young couple. They were in full view of the
side window in the living room, and we watched
them flying in and out, to and fro, with beaks
laden with grass and straw and similar materials
for household decorations.</p>

<p>Later on, when two youngsters were hatched,
there were the same endless journeyings, the
same loaded beaks. But here Augustus’s perspicacity
stood him in good stead; it was a very
short flight from the plum tree down to the
bird-board, and the pair must have nearly worn
the air out, judging by the number of times
they made the trip!</p>

<p>The tragedy happened when the youngsters
were nearly ready to leave the nest. And the
sad part of it was that we saw it all enacted before
our eyes, and yet were powerless to prevent it.</p>

<p>We had just sat down to our mid-day meal;
the day seemed all blue sky and bright flowers
and gladdening sunshine—the very last day one
ought to have met trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Augustus had gone off to give Claude a
piece of his mind that must have been owing for
some time, judging by the heat and length of
his harangue; Martha was gathering up the
biggest mouthful she could manage (and it is
astonishing how they will collect several pieces
of bread, a piece of fat and a flake of oatmeal,
packing it up securely in their beak, in order to
carry it safely).</p>

<p>I saw a big bird swoop down on to the
branch beside the nest; but big birds are so
plentiful with us, it conveyed nothing out of the
ordinary to me. It looked like a shrike, but I
couldn’t be certain. Everything happened so
quickly. It seized one of the little ones, killed
it outright with one vicious toss, while the
other baby called out in wild terror.</p>

<p>In far less time than it takes me to write this,
the whole air seemed teeming with screaming
blackbirds, dozens of them. They went for the
murderer, trying to attack him with their beaks;
but he flew off into the woods, followed by a
crowd of threatening and bewailing birds; one
could hear them in the distance when they were
no longer in sight.</p>

<p>Of course we had all rushed out into the
garden; but we could do nothing; the nest was
too high up to be reached without a ladder.</p>

<p>Then an unusual silence fell over the
garden; the majority of the birds having joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the crowd of pursuers. It is strange how
we all bury our hatchets in face of a common
danger!</p>

<p>It seemed almost death-like for the moment,
till, from the top of a larch, a chaffinch bubbled
forth. At least there was one happy bird left.
Then I bethought me about baby-blackbird No. 2.
The villain had only carried off one. We got a
ladder, but no bird was in the nest!</p>

<p>We decided it must have fallen out in the
scrimmage, and searched carefully. After a
while we found it, helpless and terrified, among
the ferns, just where it had fallen, in the grotto.</p>

<p>As it didn’t seem able to walk or fly, we left
it there, and sat down to watch events. Back
came poor Martha presently. She looked in
the nest, then flew distractedly about. But I
suppose the baby was too dazed with fright to
do a thing, at any rate it never uttered a sound
or call; and the distressed mother flew off again
to the woods on her hopeless quest.</p>

<p>We remained on watch the whole afternoon
and evening; but neither parent returned.
Then I began to get anxious. I put a little
food near the frightened crouching thing, but
it took no notice. Only once it gave a piteous
cry; how I wished it would keep it up! That
at least would surely reach the mother in time.
But it didn’t repeat the call.</p>

<p>At last we had to go in, because it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
getting dark, and every bird but our poor little
baby was safely in bed. We tried to console
ourselves by saying that it would probably be
all right, and it was wonderful how birds survived
all sorts of dangers. But, all the same,
we none of us believed we should ever see him
again; and we shook our heads silently next
morning, when we found an empty space under
the ferns, where we had left him overnight.</p>

<p>During the day, my suspicions were aroused
by the fact that Augustus returned again and
again to the bird-board and stuffed his beak full
of provender, which he carried off in the good
old way. But the moment I tried to follow
him, he merely went into a near-by tree, and
tried to say “Chut! chut!” with his mouth full!</p>

<p>It took me all the afternoon, and used up all
the stealth and cautiousness I possess, to track
him. He would not fly any more than he could
help; he kept right down on the ground,
running along with his head slightly lowered,
keeping close to the shadow of the wall, slipping
under hedges and low growths, always looking
about from side to side, standing stock still
when he scented danger—in this way he got up
the hill, and right across a field, to where a big
Wellingtonia stands like a pyramid, against a
stone wall, its outspreading branches drooping
protectingly, and hiding all sorts of secrets in its
dark green depths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Behold, there was Martha, anxiously waiting
on the doorstep, so to speak, for Augustus to
return. She was as cautious in her movements
as he was, but she couldn’t help uttering a low
“Chut! chut!” of pleasure when she saw his
beak so crammed with good things. Both
slipped in under the lowest branch.</p>

<p>I bided my time. I didn’t want to add one
single extra anxiety to the little mother heart
that was already so burdened with care. But
when at length I saw both birds slink off in
search of food, I parted the branches and looked
in. For some time I could see nothing, it was
so dark and mysterious under the heavily plumed
boughs, but the little one had learnt to use its
voice by now; “Cheep” came vigorously from
within; and then I saw our baby comfortably
ensconced on a drift of pine needles against
the wall.</p>

<p>I slipped away quietly, wondering and wondering
how in the world those little birds had
managed to get that fat youngster up that hill
and into the tree that was fully three minutes’
walk, even for me, from the old nest!</p>

<p>The baby flourished apace, and before we
returned to town, it was brought along to the
pansy border, and told to stay there quite still
for a moment, while mother got it something to
eat. But it didn’t do anything of the sort;
directly her back was turned, it hopped into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
bird’s bath, and splashed joyously till its expostulating
parents returned, alarmed out of
their senses lest it should be drowned!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After thinking it over, I fancy that for all-round
serviceability you cannot do better than
the blackbird. He starts singing in January,
as a rule, and keeps at it till August, always a
beautiful song, but not always the same song.</p>

<p>It is a clear-blue message of hope, as it rings
out on a cold winter’s day.</p>

<p>As the spring progresses, it becomes a
cascade that overflows with bubbling sound and
ends with a challenge: “Let any blackbird dare
to say he can sing that cadenza as brilliantly as
I can, and I’ll know the reason why!”</p>

<p>Later on, when the nestlings keep up a
constant demand for “more,” he only manages
to get in an occasional stanza; and that, I am
inclined to think, is when he has a difference of
opinion with another of his kind; though sometimes
he sings a rippling, pulsating song to the
setting sun.</p>

<p>But best of all I love him when the summer
has run well on into July. He is getting tired
then; two families—possibly with four in the
nest at a time—are something of a handful to
cater for. He has become draggled and weary
in appearance. His yellow-ringed eyes do not
seem as sparkling as they were. But he still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
tries to do his best, and towards sundown you
may hear him singing; one of those in my
garden seems to have a preference for an underbough
on a tall pine, where he stands almost
hidden from sight, and whistles gently and
softly—though not to me personally, as the robin
does; apparently he is talking to himself.</p>

<p>Gone is the buoyancy of his early spring
song; gone the self-assertiveness, the boastfulness
and dominating clamour of his early married
life. Now, his song is much subdued, gentler,
and strangely suggestive of a quiet, almost
saddened reminiscence.</p>

<p>Is it that his family have failed to come up
to his expectations? Is his song tinged with
regret for the lost happiness of those first
glad days of spring? Or is it the reflection
of the tranquillity that comes to those who
bravely shouldered life’s responsibility when
the time came for leaving behind the things of
youth?</p>

<p>Who knows what that subdued but exquisite
little song means, as it falls, like a rain of soft,
gentle sounds from the branches above?</p>

<p>I cannot tell, but it stirs something strangely
responsive in my own heart; I sense far-back
things that I cannot take hold of, or put into
tangible shape, and for the moment I feel
mysteriously akin to the unseen singer in the
blue-green depths of the old and rugged pine.</p>

<h2>VII<br />

<small>Only Small Talk</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I seem</span> to have wandered a long way from
Eileen, but it was really she who brought the
birds to my mind.</p>

<p>I got up early the morning after our arrival,
in order to show her the way about, and because
it is not one of my daily duties to be the first
down in the morning, I noticed all the more how
the opening of the doors and windows, to let in
the day, is something much more than the mere
undoing of locks and latches. There is nothing
to compare with the inrush of sweet morning
air that greets you on the threshold, as you take
your first look-out on a dew-sparkling garden,
probably all alive with the songs and chirps and
twitters of the birds, and teeming with the
scents of things seen and unseen, each pouring
forth its gratitude in its own way for the ever-new
miracle of the sun’s return.</p>

<p>This letting in of light and clean air, sunshine,
song and scent, after the inanimate
darkness of the night, is so wonderfully symbolic
that it seems a mistake that it has come to be
regarded as one of the inferior domestic tasks, relegated
to the minor members of the household.
And though I am not one of those exceptionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
virtuous people who habitually rise at six o’clock,
waking every one else within earshot and taking
vain pride in their performances, whenever I
chance to be the first one to welcome the
morning and let in the day, I feel there are
decided compensations for the wrench of getting
out of bed minus a cup of tea.</p>

<p>I also realize how easy it is, in the flush of
exhilaration produced by the early morning air,
to make oneself a nuisance to all who are less
energetic. For some unaccountable reason,
when I am down extra early, I always want to
bustle about, and do all sorts of rackety things
that never occur to me on the days when I
do not put in an appearance till breakfast is
ready.</p>

<p>I had opened the windows in the living-room,
and had set Eileen to make the fire, and was
seeing to things in the kitchen, when she
followed me with an excited squawk: “Oh,
ma’am, there’s somebody has lost their canary!
It was on the window ledge just now, and it’s
flown into a tree. Have you got a bird-cage
handy? I expect I could catch it. There it is
again”—pointing to a handsome yellow and
black tit who was pecking eagerly at some
bacon rind I had just hung up outside the
window.</p>

<p>I explained.</p>

<p>“Wild, is he? <i>Wild?</i>” she exclaimed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
“and don’t they charge you nothing for
them?”</p>

<p>She finished the room with one eye perpetually
on the windows.</p>

<p>Having a healthy appetite, that had been
touched up a little extra with the hill-top air,
she was more than willing to help me get the
meal ready. I made the usual preliminary
inquiries as to her experience in regard to cooking,
and was surprised to hear that she had
actually won a silver medal at a Cookery Exhibition.</p>

<p>Surely this was unexpected good fortune, and
I asked myself if I really deserved such a heaven-sent
boon as a silver-medalled cook! I decided,
however, that in view of all I had undergone in
the past at the hands of those who were not so
decorated, it was nothing more than my due
that I should be so blessed in my declining
years. My only regret was that war-time would
allow so little scope for her genius!</p>

<p>Feeling very light-hearted, and wondering
how she would get on with Abigail when cook
gave one of her periodical notices and I placed
Eileen on the permanent staff, I said: “Then I
needn’t bother about the breakfast! We will
have poached eggs on toast. I’ll lay the cloth
while you get them ready.”</p>

<p>But she looked at me doubtfully. “We
didn’t ever have <i>poached</i> eggs at the boarding-house,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
she began. “But I think I know how
to do ’em. You just break them on the gridiron
over the top of the fire, don’t you?”</p>

<p>After all, it was I who poached the eggs,
while Eileen explained that the medal had been
awarded to the cookery class at the orphanage
<i>en bloc</i>, for making a Swiss roll.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, unfortunately,
she didn’t know how to make Swiss
roll either, as she had been down with scarlet
fever that term. Still, it was her class that got
the medal, so of course she had as much right to
it as anyone else.</p>

<p>I trust I bore the disappointment complacently.
I’m fairly hardened to such sudden
drops in the kitchen thermometer.</p>

<p>The great thing about Eileen was her willingness,
and her anxiety to learn.</p>

<p>When I was seeking to impart knowledge,
however, she seemed to think it was for her also
to contribute some general information. Hence
our duologues often ran on these lines:—</p>

<p>“When you make the tea or coffee, be sure
that the water is <i>quite</i> boiling; or else——”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. Do you know, one of the
young gentlemen where I used to live, couldn’t
help being bald, no matter if he used a whole
bottle of hair restorer every day. It ran in his
fambly.”</p>

<p>“Really! Well, now we’ll fry some bacon.
You put a little of the bacon fat from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
jar into the pan first of all to get hot. Like
this.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. Isn’t it strange, grandmother
won’t never have red roses in her bonnet. Can’t
bear red.”</p>

<p>She also excelled in asking questions; from
morn till eve life seemed one long series of conundrums
which I was expected to answer. I never
realized before how many queries country life
presents; hitherto it had seemed to me such a
simple, straightforward state of existence.</p>

<p>An old man had been secured to do an
occasional odd day’s work (at highest London
prices). He described some misfortune that,
last autumn, had befallen “Hussy,” the cow who
comes for change of air into my orchard at
intervals—an apple she had eaten (one of mine,
of course) being blamed for the fact that her
milk turned off, “like vinegar ’twas.”</p>

<p>Eileen—in common with every other young
human under twenty years of age—thrilled at
the word apple, and inquired if “Hussy” had
stolen it off a tree?</p>

<p>“Stolen it off a tree!” scoffed the man;
“and why should she bother to creek her neck
up’ards when they was lying by the thousand
as thick on the ground in that thur orchard as—as—well,
as apples!”</p>

<p>Eileen looked incredulous.</p>

<p>“Yes, by the thousand they was, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wuth picking up, no one wanted ’em; no men
to make cider; no sugar to jam ’em; child’un
all got colic a’ready as bad as bad could be,
couldn’t swaller no more; too damp to keep.
Ay, and we that short o’ cider as we be!” And
the aged one—who had been coining money
hand over fist, with letter carrying, and the sale
of eggs and poultry, and a couple of pigs, and the
hay in his paddock, to say nothing of gilt-edged
easy little jobs waiting for him all about the
place at any price per hour he cared to charge,
and old age pensions paid regularly to himself
and wife—paused to shake his head and sigh
over the misfortunes of the times.</p>

<p>Eileen was likewise moved. To think of it—unwanted
apples! And no one to eat them!
She reverted to the phenomenon several times
that day, with such queries as these:—If eating
one apple turns the cow’s milk to vinegar, would
eating fifty turn it to cider? If so, wouldn’t it
be cheaper to make the cow grow cider, as the
old man said cider had riz to 7<i>d.</i> a quart, and
milk was only 6<i>d.</i> You would then make a
penny a quart profit that you could put into
the Savings Bank to help the War.</p>

<p>After watching some vegecultural operations
she inquired: “Why is it, when he puts potatoes
in the ground and beans in the ground all the
same way, the beans come out at the top of the
plant and the potatoes come out at the bottom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Another time it was: “What do they use
the sting of the nettle for?” And when she
had enlarged her garden vocabulary, she inquired:
“Is a spider an annual or a perennial?”</p>

<p>“I can’t find a tap out there to turn off the
water,” and she indicated the spring outside the
gate, tumbling out of a little wooden trough
wedged in among the rocks, into a pool below.
“I suppose they stop it at the main. What
time do they turn it off?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Never?</i> It runs
like that always! Then how long is it before
the whole lot runs away and it’s all dried up?
And don’t they ever come down on you for
wasting the water?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yet more accomplished people than Eileen
have often surprised one by their ignorance.
An experienced and supposed-to-be-highly-qualified
cook came to me one day with the sad
news that we couldn’t have any stuffing with the
duck for dinner that day as there wasn’t a single
bottle of herbs in the house. I reminded her
that there was an almost unlimited amount of
everything in the garden, including a sage
bush growing on a wall that now measures
15 feet by 6 feet. “In the garden?” she
repeated in surprise. “But I didn’t know it
was good unless it was bottled! You don’t
mean that country people use those things
raw?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt such an apologetic cannibal as I explained!</p>

<p>She it was who split up the chopping board
to light the fire, the first morning after her
arrival, because she couldn’t find a bundle of
firewood anywhere. On being referred to the
stack of dry kindling wood in the coal shed—she
had never heard of lighting fires with trees
before; never thought, indeed, to live with a
family that expected you to do such things!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On one occasion, when I was in one of the
largest and poorest of the London Elementary
Schools, where the children looked as pitifully
sordid and poverty-stricken as I have ever seen
them, I asked a few questions of one small girl
in the front row of a class. Her outside dress
consisted of an old dilapidated waistcoat worn
over a dingy flannelette nightgown, while a
ragged piece of serge fastened around the waist
with a safety-pin did duty for a skirt. But she
was only one among a classful of rags and
tatters.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” I asked, by way of
starting conversation.</p>

<p>“Victorine,” the forlorn-looking little thing
replied.</p>

<p>“And what is your lesson about?” I then
inquired.</p>

<p>“Therdelfykorrickul,” she informed me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing the bewildered look on my face, the
head mistress, who was showing me round, said,
“Enunciate your words more carefully, Victorine,
and speak slowly.”</p>

<p>Victorine understood what “speak slowly”
meant, and so she said very deliberately, “The—Delphic—Horricul.”</p>

<p>“So you are learning about the Delphic
Oracle. And what are you going to do when
you grow up?” was my next query.</p>

<p>“I’m going to work in the laundry like
muvver!”</p>

<p>We went into another classroom; here more
ragged unwashed clothes greeted me on every
hand. I had no need to ask the subject of the
lesson, for the girls were facing a blackboard
on which was written “The Characteristics of
Shelley’s Poetry.”</p>

<p>After I had seen more tatters in a third
room, where a lesson was being given on “Infinitive
Verbs,” I said to the head mistress, “If
I had this school, do you know what I should
do? I should take a class at a time, and give
out needles and cotton, and tell them to do the
best they could to sew up the rags in their
dresses and their pinafores. I would not mind
if they did not put on patches even to a thread
in the regulation way, so long as they made
some attempt to run together those rents and
slits and yawning gaps. I would let the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
lessons go till this was done. And I would not
let a girl take her place in a class in the morning
till she had mended as well as she could any
rents she had worn to school.”</p>

<p>The head mistress shook her head. “That
would not be practical; you see, it isn’t in the
Syllabus.”</p>

<p>I don’t pretend to understand the inwardness
of syllabuses, but I couldn’t help wondering if
there wasn’t an opening here for a new one.
While so much unpractical stuff is taught to the
poorer classes in elementary schools, is it any
wonder that the children know so little of the
things appertaining to daily life?</p>

<p>Eileen didn’t exactly suffer from rags. She
was as neat and patched and wholesome as her
clean, sensible grandmother could make her;
but she was forlorn-looking to the last degree.
One of the first things I tried to do was to get
her to take a little pride in her personal appearance.
And it was wonderful how she responded.
With her hair released from the uncompromising,
tight screw that had been kept in place by three
big iron-looking hair-pins, and done higher up,
and more loosely over the forehead, and a pretty
collar and blue bow for her Sunday blouse, she
looked a different being.</p>

<p>“Poor little thing, she has never had a soul
take any interest in how she looks,” Ursula remarked
to me. “And even though we’re not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
allowed to cast our bread upon the waters,
nowadays, they haven’t said anything officially
about ribbons.” And so we searched our drawers
for suitable finery that might bring a little colour
into Eileen’s hitherto drab outlook. Virginia
followed suit, remarking that she liked to scatter
little seeds of kindness by the wayside, since you
never know what may result.</p>

<p>True! She didn’t!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Eileen gloated over the odds and
ends, fixing weird and crazy-looking bows to her
black sailor hat, draping her shoulders with bits
of lace to see if they would make a collar, and
standing in front of the kitchen glass trying the
effect of pinks and purples under her chin.</p>

<p>For a time, the questions ceased.</p>

<h2>VIII<br />

<small>A Cold Snap</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> a couple of days the sun was radiant, and
the air actually warm. We agreed with each
other that Italy and the South of France weren’t
in it.</p>

<p>We started gardening with all the zest of
backwoods-women, who know that the only
vegetables they can hope for are those they
themselves grow. Unlike the majority of Londoners,
the War had not added much to our
knowledge in this direction. I had not owned
a house in the country many months before I
learnt the value of first-hand home production.
Hence, when the allotment fever set in, we
were quite able to keep pace with the rest of the
world despite our failing intellects. The only
thing that differentiated us from the remainder
of our fellow-citizens in the Metropolis, was the
fact that we appeared to be the only ones who
did not feel themselves competent to bestow
unlimited information and advice, in season and
out of season, to all and sundry, on every
imaginable and unimaginable point connected
with the raising of food crops.</p>

<p>One of the many reasons for the charm that
envelops our life at the hillside cottage lies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the fact that it brings us much closer to the
fundamental principle of keeping alive than is
ever possible in town with its over-civilization.
Of course, it isn’t desirable that our mental and
spiritual interests should centre in the question
of what we shall eat and what we shall drink,
and wherewithal shall we keep warm and comfortable,
but I think a woman suffers a distinct
loss when she eliminates these matters entirely
from her horizon.</p>

<p>I know, from personal experience, that there
comes a period in our lives when we women feel
that there are much higher enterprises beckoning
us, that we (individually, not collectively)
are called to do some work in the world that is
far greater than seeing to meals, and keeping
the household machinery moving unobtrusively
and with regularity; but it is fortunate that
there eventually returns to us (if we are properly
balanced) a realization that some of our very
best work can be put into the making of a
home, and that far from it being narrow and
sordid and selfish to devote a large part of ourselves
to household administration, it is in
reality one of the widest spheres that a woman
can choose, and one that will give her the
biggest scope for bringing happiness and
strength and health to others—and, after all,
isn’t that the avowed aim of the most advanced
of modern feminists?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Still, I admit that our cramped surroundings
and jaded, strained existence in cities do not
always make a round of domestic duties seem
alluring to the woman who has to cram her
belongings and her aspirations into a small
modern flat, or who has to do her cooking in
one of the unhealthy, sunless basements that
prevail in the older houses in towns. A woman
needs fresh air, sunshine and a garden if the best
is to be brought out of her. Oh, yes, I know
some few women have done great things without
one or another of these items—but probably
they would have done still more if they had had
the opportunity to come to their full development
under more favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>I’m not surprised that women, whose existence
is limited by the narrow environment of
towns, so continually beat the air with a longing
to do something more than seems possible in
the flat or dull suburban villa. Civilization has
taken out of their hands so many of the useful
occupations that formerly kept women busy—and
worthily busy too; and it is not to be wondered
at that they cry out for something to do,
and invent Causes on which to expend their zeal
and energy. The preparation of food, the
laundry work, and indeed most household duties
are now done for us in cities on the “penny-in-the-slot”
principle (only we have to put a
shilling in the slot, as a rule, for the pennyworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of result that we receive); and it is small
wonder that so few of us can work up any
interest in the process.</p>

<p>But how are matters to be altered? you ask
me. I don’t know! Pray don’t think I’m
proposing to find solutions for grave problems
in these stories! I’m only giving you a record
of facts, just simple everyday little happenings
“of no value to anyone save the owner.” And
we’ll leave it at that, if you don’t mind, and
return to the garden.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before the War labour was not so scarce,
and there was no need for us to plant the vegetables
ourselves, unless we desired to do so.
Now, however, one’s own personal work was a
valuable asset, and we put our backs into it—at
least Ursula and I did; Virginia was engaged
most of the time in describing the sort of tools
she would make, if she were in that line of
business, to obviate the grave spinal trouble she
was certain she was developing.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to imply that Virginia isn’t a
good gardener; she can be an excellent one
when she likes, for she knows what gardening
really stands for in the way of hard work.
Whereas some of my would-be assistant gardeners
seem to think the chief requisites are a
comfortable hammock and a book; or, at most,
a “picture” muslin frock and a pretty basket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and a pair of baby scissors. Such girls remind
me of many who write and inquire if I have a
vacancy for a sub-editor in my office, the chief
qualification stated in their letters being that
they “do so love to browse among books.”</p>

<p>Virginia isn’t like that; she puts on a
business-like garb, and knows—and annexes—a
good tool when she sees it. But it is her bright
ideas that are the hindrance to progress. She
wasted ten minutes that morning explaining to
me that she was sure, if I would only have
turnips planted in the mint bed, it would be
another war economy, as the mint flavour might
permeate the turnips, and thus save double
expense with lamb.</p>

<p>And then another ten minutes went in
enlarging on the grasping nature of the makers
of gardening gloves in not supplying four pairs
of extra thumbs with each pair, since any intelligent
gardener could wear out eight thumbs
with one pair in the simplest day’s gardening.
She offered to let me use the idea free of charge
in my magazine, if I would undertake to keep
her supplied with gardening gloves for the rest
of her natural life; but she stipulated that they
must be proper leather ones, not the four-and-sixpenny
war variety she was then wearing,
composed of unbleached calico, with merely a
chamois postage-stamp stuck on the front of
each finger and thumb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>In the intervals of conversation she aided us
with our digging, yet, in spite of the National
Call to spend as much on seed potatoes as
would keep the family in vegetables for a couple
of years, we continually found ourselves drifting
away from the ground we were trenching, for
the violets were already out, also some early
primroses, and little white stars were showing
on the wild strawberry trails in sheltered corners
under walls that faced south.</p>

<p>And the garden is full of sheltered nooks,
despite its being so high up. As the ground
slopes towards the south, every wall that props
up the garden—and there are so many, like
giant steps down the steep hillside—gives protection
from the cold winds to the little growing
things that nestle in every crevice and on the
ground below. Everywhere the pennywort was
sending out clear green disks from the mysterious
depths of crannies in the wall. Crocuses were
showing orange buds in the garden beds. One
precocious pansy held up a white flower, streaked
and splashed with purple.</p>

<p>“Spring has really come,” we all chorused.
And oh, how good it seemed to be done with
the winter; such a winter too! Surely the
longest and most awful winter humanity has
ever known!</p>

<p>With spring and summer immediately before
us, as it seemed, we decided to leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
trenching just for that day, and explore the
lanes and woods. The lichens and mosses were
at the height of their beauty—a beauty that
would fade once the sun got any power. The
wall-stones were splashed with browns and
greys, rust-colour and orange, black and olive,
and one particular lichen that is our especial joy
tints the stone a milky pea-green shade that is
unlike any other colour I can recall.</p>

<p>Last year’s bramble leaves were purple and
scarlet and crimson and yellow. Where the
small ivy creeping up the walls had been touched
by the frost, it had turned a vivid yellow mottled
with warm brown and crimson. And it is surprising,
once you take note of it, how much
crimson is used by Nature where you would
expect to find only green; and not merely a
dull red, it is a brilliant, vivid carmine that is
dropped about in quiet, unsuspected places,
lighting up dark patches, emphasizing sombre
details that one might otherwise overlook.</p>

<p>We were turning over a handful of brown
leaves under an oak tree in the wood; there we
found the streak of crimson showing inside an
acorn that had just burst to let out a young
shoot that was seeking about for roothold below
and light up above. Not only one, but hundreds
of similar brilliant touches were scattered about
where the fertile acorns lay among the moss
and last year’s fern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>In one secluded spot, where the cold had not
been severe enough to wither last year’s foliage
on the undergrowth, long sprays of ground ivy,
climbing over a fallen branch, had turned to
deep wine colour, stems and all, and lay, as
Eileen said, “beautiful enough for one of them
lovely wreaths of leaves they put round best
hats.” Certainly it looked more artificial than
natural, if one didn’t happen to know that
ground ivy often takes on this tint in its
declining days.</p>

<p>Thanks to Tennyson, we all know that
rosy plumelets tuft the larch; but it doesn’t
matter how many times you see them, they are
always worth looking at—and marvelling at—again.</p>

<p>And there seems no limit to the crimson
splashes. Is there anything anywhere that can
compare with the Herb Robert, its leaves far
more radiant than its blossoms; or the leaves of
the evening primrose when they start to fade
at the bottom of the stem; or the waning
foliage of the sorrel?</p>

<p>To make a list of the crimson touches (as
distinct from the reddish-brown) that one finds
on stems and foliage any day in the country,
would be a revelation to most of us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though the sun had been so bright when we
started, it doesn’t do to trust too much in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
English spring, and we presently noticed a very
decided change; the temperature dropped with
great rapidity, as clouds came up and hid the
sun, and the hills that towered about us suddenly
loomed gloomy and forbidding. The
wind veered round from south-west to north-east;
and by evening it was piercingly, bitterly cold.</p>

<p>Taking a last look round with the lantern
before we locked up for the night, not a sound
could be heard; everything was absolutely still,
with that unearthly silence of a land suddenly
gripped by overpowering cold. I glanced at
the thermometer hanging on the outside wall;
it already registered three degrees below freezing;
it would probably be ten before morning.</p>

<p>We bolted the door and shut out the cold,
hoping no one was wandering lost on the hills
that night (not that anyone ever is, but it is
pleasant to have kind charitable thoughts like
that, on a bleak night, as you put yet another
log on the fire).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next morning, as it was colder and more
perishing than ever, I decided to cope with
several days’ arrears of office work, piling itself
up in all directions. Virginia said it was just as
well the weather necessitated our remaining
indoors, as she could now get on with <i>her</i> work.
Of course we asked: What work?</p>

<p>She informed us that she was engaged upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
an anthology, “Shakespeare and the Great
War.” She felt that “Shakespeare and Everything
Else” had been done pretty thoroughly—by
less competent people than herself, it is true;
but, all the same, the poet had been dealt with
exhaustively from every point of view but that
of the War. Also, the War had been dealt with,
<i>in extenso</i>, from every point of view but Shakespeare’s.
Hence, her present literary effort.</p>

<p>And would I kindly give her any quotations
I could think of, that had any bearing on this
world-crisis.</p>

<p>All my brain was equal to was—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tell me, where is fancy bred?”</p></div>

<p>which undoubtedly indicated that the War Loaf
was known to pall on the public taste even in
Shakespeare’s time.</p>

<p>She said she had expected me to say that, it
was so obvious. Nevertheless, I noticed she
hurriedly jotted it down.</p>

<p>We asked her to read her MS. so far as she
had gone; it seemed a pity for us to overlap.</p>

<p>“I’ve made a fair start,” she explained, “but
the trouble is they all turn out so awkwardly.
For instance, the first quotation I have down is—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth
meat to her household’</p></div>

<p>—anyone can see Daylight Saving there——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally, I opened my mouth to speak, but
she cut me short, testily:</p>

<p>“Of course I know as well as you that it
isn’t Shakespeare—at least I wasn’t reared a
heathen!—but that’s just the tiresome part
of it. Every quotation I think of isn’t Shakespeare
at all. Here’s another that would do
beautifully (and take up a nice bit of space
on the page too),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘The upper air burst into life!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And a hundred fire-flags’ sheen,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To and fro they were hurried about!</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And to and fro, and in and out,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The wan stars danced between.’</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Even a child could tell you they were the
searchlights trying to spot a Zepp.—only it isn’t
Shakespeare! It’s very worrying. Yet I know
if only I could get the book done, there would
be a fortune in it. W. S. always sells, and he’s
so respectable too!”</p>

<p>I said I was sorry my office duties had prior
claim on my time, and I urged Ursula to do her
sisterly part. But she said she couldn’t be
bothered just then; her mind was more than
fully occupied in trying to lay the blame for
everything on the right person.</p>

<p>So I took Virginia’s MS. and read it down.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
“How full of briars is this working-day world.”<br />
</p>

<p>This proves that barbed wire entanglements were
known in the seventeenth century.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
<p class="center">
“How far that little candle throws his beams!”<br />
</p>

<p>This indicates clearly that Shakespeare was fined
for failing to comply with the Lighting Restrictions.</p>

<p>That he was compelled to pay War Profits out of
the “royalties” on his plays is evidenced by these
poignant words in <i>Macbeth:</i>—</p>

<p class="center">
“Nought’s had, all’s spent,”<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">and doubtless there was a subtle reference to War
taxation in</p>

<p>“Age cannot wither nor custom stale her infinite
variety.”</p>

<p>The unfailing hold of Shakespeare on humanity is
the fact that he touched upon all phases of life.
(This sentence was Virginia’s own literary contribution
to the “Anthology.”) For example (she went
on), even a sugar shortage was known in his day.
To what else could he have been referring when he
wrote</p>

<p class="center">
“Sweet are the uses of adversity,”<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">and can anyone doubt that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Double, double, toil and trouble,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: .5em;">Fire burn and cauldron bubble,”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">points to meatless days?</p></div>

<p>Here we were interrupted by a knock at the
door. It was Miss Primkins, an elderly lady
who lives by herself (or at least with Rehoboam,
her cat) in a pretty little cottage further down
the hill. Miss Primkins has been hard hit by
the War, but no matter how she has to skimp
and save in other ways, she never relaxes her
work for the wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>And it was about her contribution to Queen
Mary’s Needlework Guild that she came up to
consult me. Not that we started there straight
away—of course not. We talked about the
shortage of sugar, and the high cost of boots,
and the scarcity of chicken food, and the price
of meat, and the difficulty of knowing how to
feed Rehoboam adequately and yet in strict
accordance with official regulations, and the
colour of the bread, and “what are we coming
to,” and other topical matters like that. Then,
when I had pressed Miss Primkins several times
to stay to our midday meal, and she had as many
times assured me that she must not stay another
minute, grateful though she was for my kind
invitation, as she had put on the potatoes to boil
before she came out, she produced (in an undertone)
a paper parcel from her bag, and with much
hesitation explained that she wanted advice on a
private matter.</p>

<p>I was all attention.</p>

<p>Undoing the paper, she displayed what
looked like a round bolster case made of pink
and blue striped flannelette. As she held it up
for inspection, it “flared” at the top (to use a
dressmaker’s term) with merely a small round
opening at the bottom.</p>

<p>I glanced it over as intelligently as I knew
how, and then inquired what it was.</p>

<p>“It’s a pyjama for a soldier,” she murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
modestly, in a very low voice. “I’ve cut it
exactly by the paper pattern, yet Miss Judson,
who saw it yesterday, says she doesn’t believe
it’s right. We’ve neither of us ever made one
before, so I thought I would run up to you
with it; you would be <i>sure</i> to know.”</p>

<p>“Er—h’m—ah—yes,” I said, as light dawned.
“It’s all right so far as it goes; but where’s the
other leg?”</p>

<p>“The other leg?” she echoed, “there was
only one in the pattern.”</p>

<p>“Of course; but you should have cut it out
in double material; the garment requires two
legs, you know.”</p>

<p>“Does it!” she exclaimed in genuine surprise.
“Why, I thought it must be intended for a
soldier who had had his other leg amputated!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before Virginia put away her “Anthology,”
preparatory to having lunch, she added another
quotation to her list—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“For never anything can be amiss</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When simpleness and duty tender it,”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">and against this she scribbled, “one-legged
pyjamas”—doubtless for elucidation and amplification
at a later date. I hope I haven’t forestalled
her.</p>

<h2>IX<br />

<small>Snowdrifts</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was later in the day, and the zest for Shakespeare
had waned. Virginia had moved from
beside the fire and was sitting nearer the window,
in order to get what light there was from the
sun just disappearing behind the opposite hills.
She was very busy with some crochet edging she
had lately started. It was the first time within
the memory of living woman that Virginia had
been seen with a crochet-hook in her hand—fancy-work
had never been her strong point—hence
the inordinate pride with which she patted
out the short fragment on any available surface
at frequent intervals, surveying it from different
points of view with her head cricked at various
angles, and calling upon all and sundry to admire.</p>

<p>After moving nearer the window she again
patted out the seven small scallops on her knee,
as usual, and then became meditative. No one
paid much attention to her, however. I was
sitting on the settle, with a heaped-up table
before me, absorbed in MSS., which I was
reading, and then sorting into various piles—for
printer, for reserve, for return—and arranging
these on the seat beside me; important work,
which accounted for my preoccupation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Ursula was busily engaged in the laudable
endeavour to construct a pair of child’s knickers
out of two pairs of stocking legs. Someone had
told her this could be done. It had appealed to
her as a serviceable way to use up done-with
stockings (and she assured me the problem of
what to do with these “done-withs” had been a
long-standing mental burden), while at the same
time one might be conferring a benefit upon the
poor. The fact that the modern “poor” would
have scorned anything so economical did not
worry her.</p>

<p>At last Virginia broke the silence. “It’s
really quite remarkable! I don’t know that I’ve
met with a more extraordinary crochet pattern
than this,” she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it from?” I asked rather
absently, as I went on with my work.</p>

<p>“From one of the magazines you are
supposed to edit,” she said blandly.</p>

<p>“What is there extraordinary about it?” I
inquired, now thoroughly roused up to give the
matter all my attention, while Ursula laid down
the dislocated stocking leg she had been wrestling
with.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s like this. There is the pattern,
you see,” pointing to a picture I had seen before,
“and there are the directions. When you’ve
worked them through once, that makes one
scallop. Do you see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>We said we saw it quite plainly.</p>

<p>“Then, you notice it says at the very end,
‘go back and repeat from the first row’? Now
this is the extraordinary part of the affair; every
time I go back and repeat from the first row it
makes an entirely different scallop. The last
time but one, you see, the scallop came on the
opposite side of the sewing-on edge; I thought
<i>that</i> was interesting enough! But now I find
this last scallop has <i>turned a corner</i>. Funny,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>For the first time we gave Virginia’s bit of
edging serious attention. What she had done
with those directions it was impossible to say,
but the result was certainly peculiar.</p>

<p>“That will be a valuable piece of lace by the
time it’s finished,” I said. “What are you going
to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I’m making it as a Christmas present for
you,” she replied sweetly. “I think it may
help to promote conversation if you display it at
your social functions. I know you’re going to
say how unselfish it is of me. I think, myself, I
mellow as I age.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I replied politely, and suggested
that we should go for a walk, lest such concentrated
thinking should be too much for her.</p>

<p>“If you’d been a properly-minded hostess
you would have proposed that long ago. I’ve
been waiting anxiously for it, only there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Ursula absorbed in that outfit that no masculine
infant anywhere would recognise——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve given up the knicker idea long
ago,” interrupted Ursula. “I’ve turned them
into chest-protectors for the old people in the
infirmary. And now, as a war economy, I’m
going to enlarge your vests (I neither ask for,
nor expect, gratitude!). The laundry having
shrunk them to waistbands, I shall add an
upper and a lower storey.”</p>

<p>“—and <i>you</i> sit hour after hour reading MSS.
What are they all about? What’s that one in
your hand, for instance?”</p>

<p>“This one,” holding up some sheets of
violently-written paper that almost burst through
the envelope, “is an anonymous letter from
some irate lady who objects to something or
someone appearing in our pages. I haven’t time
to read it, but if you care to wade through it——”</p>

<p>“Anonymous letters are so futile.”</p>

<p>“Anything but,” I told her. “It is always
a pleasant thing, at the end of the day, to feel
that you have, even in a slight way, contributed
to anyone’s happiness. And I’m sure the lady
who dug her pen into that anonymous letter was
very happy when she posted it. Glad am I,
therefore, to be the unworthy instrument permitted
to promote her joy!”</p>

<p>Virginia merely snorted. “What’s the next
MS. about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is a very long poem on the War, and
the writer explains that she has made all the
lines run straight on in order to save paper, but
doubtless I can find out where it rhymes. It
begins ‘Hail, proud mother of nations who dwell
in these sea-girt islands for centuries past and
centuries yet to be——’”</p>

<p>Virginia said she’d skip the rest, please, and
wasn’t there a little light fiction anywhere in
the chaos before me?</p>

<p>“This is a story of a beautiful Russian
princess who was doomed to live in a lonely
castle, with no one but her aged and decrepit
nurse, in the very centre of a pathless Siberian
forest, hundreds of miles from everybody, until
the spell should be broken——”</p>

<p>“What spell?” inquired Ursula.</p>

<p>“(I don’t know—the writer doesn’t say)—until
the spell should be broken, when she would
be free. She was the most exquisite vision that
ever burst upon human sight. Not only were her
features perfect, and her hair a rippling cascade
of gold, but her dress was grace and beauty
combined.”</p>

<p>“Then it wasn’t one of <i>this</i> season’s models!”
ejaculated Ursula, “hence it must have been
out-of-date. All the same, I’d like to know who
was her dressmaker. Did they think to mention
the name?”</p>

<p>(“No, that is not stated.)—She used to spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
her days listening to the wolves who congregated
all around the castle howling and gnashing their
horrid fangs, till one day an honest, sturdy
forester approached, and with one fell swoop
slew dozens of them. Whereupon the Princess
Elizabeth—for such was her name—opened the
door and cried, ‘Welcome, deliverer!’ and in
less time than it takes me to tell you, that aged
and decrepit nurse had prepared, all unaided, a
sumptuous wedding banquet, while gorgeously
apparelled guests arrived in battalions from nowhere.
Then, just as they were about to be
married, the honest, sturdy forester, no longer
able to conceal his identity, confessed that he
was indeed the Prince.”</p>

<p>“What Prince?” inquired the interrupter
again.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, and the writer doesn’t say,
and I wish you would remember, Ursula, that in
the larger proportion of MSS. sent to editors it
is customary for the writers to omit the essential
details!”</p>

<p>“Then I’d just as soon go for a walk as hear
any more,” she said with decision.</p>

<p>Whereupon we got into big coats and
thick gloves and tied on our hats with motor
scarfs, I don’t mean the filmy wisps one wears
when motoring in the park, but those large,
solid, thick, brown, woollen scarves that look as
though they had been made from a horse-blanket—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
sort that the West End window dresser in
desperation labels “dainty!” But the air was
bitingly cold, and we were so high up among the
hills, that no wraps would have been too warm
that day. Then we started off, after I had said
a final word to Eileen about the necessity for
keeping the kettle boiling, as we shouldn’t be
gone long. She had assured me many times
already that she wasn’t the least bit nervous
about being left alone—rather liked it, in fact.
She was blissfully engaged at the moment in
trying to construct a “dainty evening camisole”
(as per some penny weekly she had bought
coming down) out of the satin ribbon and lace
from Virginia’s last year’s hat.</p>

<p>The small white dog with the brown ears
accompanied us to the gate, but decided that,
with the thermometer just where it was at that
moment, home-keeping hearts were happiest; so
he promptly returned to the hearthrug.</p>

<p>The sun had disappeared, but there was still
light on the hill-tops, though the valley below
was fast settling down to darkness. Virginia
suggested the lantern, but I thought we should
not need it, more especially as a moon was due
immediately. So we set off at a swinging pace.</p>

<p>Already, owing to the severity of the frost,
the roads rang like iron to our tread. Every
stalk and twig was glistening with rime and
feathered with hoar-frost. No sign of life did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
we see in all that walk. Where were the birds,
and squirrels, and rabbits, and pheasants, and all
the hundreds of timid wild things we were
accustomed to meet on our summer rambles?
We hoped they were safely tucked away in
barns or burrows, or sleeping in warm hayricks,
for nothing else above ground would give them
any shelter. I thought of the row of twittering
swallows that always perch themselves along the
ridge of the cottage roof on hot summer afternoons,
and felt glad they had gone off to a
warmer climate.</p>

<p>But for ourselves, we would not have exchanged
the weather that moment for any other,
no matter how balmy. There is something
remarkably exhilarating in the clear cold air of
such a day on the hilltops, and as we mounted
up and up our spirits rose with us—even though
the roads were rough and terribly hard on war-time
leather.</p>

<p>I once remarked to a local resident that I
found our stony hillside roads a bit trying, to
say nothing of the side paths.</p>

<p>“Well now, I do be s’prised to hear ’ee a-say
that,” he replied. “For the on’y time I were
up to Lunnon—I went for a day scursion—d’you
know my legs did that <i>hake</i> when I got
back, I were a week getting over it. It were all
along o’ they flat stones what they do have up
there; why, if you believe me, I was a-near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
toppling over every other minute. There weren’t
ne’er a blessed thing to catch holt onter with
your toes! I felt as though the pavemint was
a-coming up to knock my head. Now on these
here roads o’ ourn you can’t slip far, because
there’s always summat of a rock or big stone to
trip up agin.”</p>

<p>For myself, however, I sometimes think I
would prefer the said rocks and stones if they
were boiled a bit, and then mangled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At last we reached the crest of the hill, and
paused to get our breath. The silence was awe-inspiring.
At all other times there is a persistent
hum of insects, or cheep of birds, or the rustling
of leaves and swaying grasses—movement and
sound somewhere, night as well as day. But
when the earth has been swept by the magic of
frost, then there is silence indeed. From where
we stood, we might have been alone on the
very edge of the world. No house was visible,
and although we knew that the little village
lay in the valley below us, we could see nothing
of it.</p>

<p>All was grey, merging into indigo in the
depths of the coombes. Grey were the trees on
the farther hills, grey unrelieved by the lights
and shadows that gaily chase each other over the
steeps in sunny weather, as the white clouds sail
across the sky above them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Near at hand the trees took on more individuality.
The straight columns of the larches
were mysterious-looking and awe-inspiring,
suggesting regiments of soldiers suddenly called
to a halt. Pale grey beeches, that in damp
weather show a vivid emerald green down the
north side of their huge trunks, where moss
flourishes undisturbed, were now stretching out
strong bare arms over the carpet of many
years’ leaves lying thickly beneath them. Silver
birch stems gleamed in contrast to the glossy
dark green of innumerable aged yews that dotted
the woods—ancient inhabitants, indeed, standing
hoary and heroic like some dark-visaged
guardians of the forest, among a host of newcomers
of a far younger generation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But while we were standing there, a sound
suddenly broke the stillness, a sound I have
heard hundreds of times on those hills, yet never
without an eerie feeling. It begins far away, a
low undertone murmur; gradually it comes
nearer and nearer, getting louder and louder, till it
becomes almost a roar, and then—<i>diminuendo</i>—it
passes on and is finally lost in the far
distance.</p>

<p>It is only the wind as it suddenly rushes
through the river gorge; but as it tears at the
forests on the hillsides, and lashes the branches
together, it produces a strangely uncanny sound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
more especially when the trees are bare and
extremely vibrant.</p>

<p>Hearing this, one can understand the origin
of the old-time legends about headless horsemen
galloping past on windy nights, and similar hair-raising
stories. As a child, when I often visited
at another house in this region (for four generations
of us have climbed these hills and explored
the valleys), I heard these same “headless horsemen”
gallop along the slopes on many stormy
nights; and despite my years and my common
sense, I still feel the same creepy shiver in the
back of my neck when they have a particularly
mad stampede past my cottage door, for then
they always pause to give the weirdest of howls
through the keyholes!</p>

<p>“How dark it is getting!” exclaimed Ursula.
“Where is your moon? And just hear the
wind coming up the valley!”</p>

<p>It had not reached us as yet, but the words
had scarcely left her lips before it came—swish—full
upon us. We had to grip each other and
plant our walking-sticks firmly on the ground
to keep our feet. And then we knew what
the sudden change meant, for next moment
down came the snow—snow such as the town-dweller
knows nothing about, for in cities
there are buildings to break the force of the
elements; but on these heights there is nothing
to impede the fury of the storm as it gallops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
over the upper regions, crashing and smashing
as it goes.</p>

<p>The snow dashed in our eyes; it got inside
our coat-collars; it clogged up our hair; it
swirled and “druv” (as they say locally) till it
made our heads dizzy, and our eyes smarted with
trying to see through the whirling mass.</p>

<p>Owing to our exposed position we felt the
full force of the storm, and it was a difficult
matter to make headway in the blinding flakes
and stinging wind.</p>

<p>“There is a short cut through the wood,
further along the road; let us get home as soon
as we can,” I said, leading the way, and we
staggered on against the blizzard, till we came
to the wood, and plunged from the road into its
recesses. But I soon found it is one thing to
know the way through a dense mass of trees in
bright sunshine with a path clearly defined, and
quite another thing to find one’s way in the
twilight, with a gale blowing in one’s teeth and
every landmark obliterated by the rapidly falling
snow.</p>

<p>We stumbled along for some time, over the
rough stones and great boulders, lovely enough
in summer with their coverings of ivy, moss, and
fern, but very painful and cold for the shins
when you tumble over them in the snow.
Before long it was quite evident to me that we
were merely wandering at large among the trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and scrambling among the undergrowth of stalks
and bracken, our hats catching in the hanging
branches, our skirts being clutched at by the all-pervading
bramble—path there was none. I
had to admit I had lost my bearings, though as
we were going steadily downhill, I knew we
should arrive at the other side presently, as downhill
was our destination. What little conversation
we indulged in—beyond the usual exclamations
every time we tripped over something—had to
be done in shouts, so high was the wind.</p>

<p>In this way we tumbled on for about half an
hour. Just as Virginia was confiding to me—<i>fortissimo</i>
above the blizzard—how she wished
she had been nicer to her family when she had
the opportunity, and how sweet and forgiving
she would have been to them all had she but
known that I was going to take her out to an
arctic grave, the snow ceased, the clouds broke,
the moon appeared, and at the same time we
cleared the wood and struck a familiar lane—“Agag’s
Path” we had named it, on account of
the need for walking delicately.</p>

<p>By way of keeping up our spirits, Ursula
began to chant, to some lilting, sprightly tune,
that most lugubrious poem, “Lucy Gray.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The storm came up before its time,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">She wandered up and down;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And many a hill did Lucy climb,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But never reached the town.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">When she got to the verse—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“They followed from the snowy bank</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Those footmarks, one by one,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Into the middle of the plank,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And farther there were none!”—</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Virginia exclaimed, “For mercy sake, if you
<i>must</i> wail, do wail something cheerful and lively.
‘The Boy stood on the Burning Deck,’ for
instance, would warm one up a bit, instead of
that other shivery thing.”</p>

<p>By the time we reached our gate the storm
was over, though the wind was still sweeping
restlessly over the hills. A dog belonging to a
neighbouring farmer jumped over the garden
wall. He had evidently called in the hope of
getting a chance to settle a long-standing score
he had against my own innocent-looking animal,
who was ever a terrible fighter! We paid no
attention to the dog, however, but hurried up
the path, only too thankful to see the lights of
home, and glad that Eileen had forgotten to pull
down the dark blinds. Nevertheless, I wondered
that she did not open the door so soon as she
heard the gate. I put my hand on the latch,
but to my surprise the door was locked! I
rattled the latch and knocked. The dog whined
inside and gave impatient little short barks
which always mean a summons to someone to
open the door and let me in. But the door
remained locked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Eileen’s voice within—</p>

<p>“Are you quite by yourselves? Has the
wolf gone?”</p>

<p>“Open the door at once, and don’t talk
nonsense,” I said firmly, trying not to sound as
irritated as I felt.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it isn’t nonsense. I’ve seen them
out there! One was there just now. And I’m
not going to risk my life by opening the door if
he’s there still.”</p>

<p>Evidently <i>our</i> lives were unimportant! “If
you don’t open the door this very instant,” I
said, “I’ll get in through the window. You
must be out of your senses, and you have always
professed to be so brave!”</p>

<p>The key grated in the lock, and the door
opened half an inch, while Eileen’s nose peeped
at the crack, to make sure we were not the wolf.
Then she explained, “If you’d been here for
hours and hours, as I have”—(we had actually
been gone an hour and a half, though I could
understand the sudden storm, and our delay, had
made her nervous)—“hearing those wolves outside
a-howling and howling and gnashing their
horrid fangs, you wouldn’t wonder I was afraid
to open the door. I saw one skulking off just
before you came in.”</p>

<p>I understood the situation immediately.
“Eileen,” I said severely, “what have you been
reading?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“I couldn’t help just seeing what it was all
about when I spread the sheets on the dresser.
You said I must have fresh papers for the
dresser and shelves——”</p>

<p>“Fresh paper on the dresser?” I exclaimed,
and went hurriedly into the kitchen. Sure
enough, the dresser, the pantry and scullery
shelves, and all other available surfaces, including
the deep window-sill and the tops of the
safes, had been carefully covered with white
paper; prompt investigation proved them to be
pages from some of the various MSS. I had left
in piles on the settle when I went out. Of course
the writing was face downwards. I lifted things
and examined what was beneath. The vegetable
dishes on the dresser were reposing on portions
of a serial story; canisters, saltbox and biscuit-tins
shared the back of one of a series of Nature
Study articles; the Siberian wolves were gnashing
their horrid fangs beneath the knife-machine.
I left the anonymous letter to an amiable if
inglorious end, laid along the saucepan shelf,
but I hurriedly collected the rest to the accompaniment
of Eileen’s plaintive tones—</p>

<p>“I thought you had put them there for
waste paper. And the back of every sheet was
so beautifully clean, and I had made my kitchen
look <i>so</i> nice with them.”</p>

<p>All of which goes to illustrate the risk
one runs in sending MSS. to editors, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
especially to feminine editors possessed of
kitchens.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though the fall of snow did not last very
long, the wind howled and moaned around the
house all the evening, and roared in the wide
chimneys like a 32-feet open diapason pedal
pipe. Virginia suggested to Eileen that she
should go out and put a little salt on the wolves’
tails to see if that would quiet them.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoy the moaning of the wind
if I am surrounded by creature comforts—a big
fire, a good cup of tea, or something interesting
in that line. I never feel a desire for intellectual
or introspective pursuits when the moan is
most robust. When a raw nor’wester or a
bullying sou’wester howls outside the door and
windows, making the pine trees creak and
groan like the wheels of an old timber waggon,
and the evergreen firs wildly wave their branches
like long dark plumes, I want to be able to hug
myself to myself in the midst of warmth and
good cheer, and in the company of some congenial
fellow being. Then I give the fire a
further poke and another log, remarking contentedly:
“Just <i>hark</i> at the wind! <i>What</i> a
night! Isn’t it cosy indoors!” And the brass
candlesticks on the mantelpiece, and the plates
and jugs and dishes on the dresser blink
acquiescence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Under such circumstances I love the howlers
on these hills. But if I were a studious ascetic,
burning the midnight oil—and very little else—I’m
afraid that the sound of the wailing up and
down the scale in minor sixths, coupled with the
lack of comforting food and blazing fire and
sympathetic companionship, would make me
desperately melancholy indeed.</p>

<p>Now we were indoors we could defy the
weather, and here at least firewood was plentiful—not
the “five sticks a penny, take it or leave
it,” that had been our portion in town, but as
much as ever one wanted, and plenty more
where the last came from. We soon had
crackling blazes all over the house, and you
should have seen Eileen’s almost awestruck
countenance when she was told to make herself
a fire in her own bedroom! “<i>Now</i> I know
what it’s like to be the Queen!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>I had been literally fire-starved, owing to
the need for economizing on fuel in town; and
now I was loose among my own woods again,
with snapped branches lying in all directions
among the undergrowth, I went in for an orgy
of warmth. Large chunks of apple wood and
stubby bits the wind had tossed down from the
creaking fir-trees, made crackling glowing fires
in the big open grates. An absurd butterfly
unthawed itself from some crevice among the
ceiling beams and came walking deliberately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
down the window curtain, evidently under
the impression that he was in for a sultry
summer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For some time we sat and watched the
splendour of it all.</p>

<p>When you are burning logs from old, sea-going
ships, you see again the blue and saffron
of the sky, and the green and peacock tints of
the ocean; and in like manner you can see
leaping from our forest logs the crimson and
yellow and gold that once blazed in the autumn
glory of the tree-covered hills, and the glow of
the fire gives back the warmth and the sunshine
that the trees caught in their leaves and
cherished in their rugged branches.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I dropped off to sleep that night with the
flickering fire-glow whispering of comfort and
rest for body and brain. Yes, despite the
soothing balm of it all, and the certainty of
safety from “the terror that walks by night” so
that one could sleep without that sense of constant
listening that has become second nature
with those of us who live in town, I could not
enjoy it with the old-time zest. Who could,
with the thought ever on one’s heart: what
about this lad, and that one? where are <i>they</i>
lying this bitter night?</p>

<p>Physical sense becomes numbed when one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
lives perpetually in the shadow of possible
tragedy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Probably it was the after-effect of our
struggle with the wind and weather that caused
us all to sleep very soundly that night; at any
rate, it was broad daylight before anyone stirred
in the cottage next morning, and we missed the
doings of the storm king in the interval. When
I first opened my eyes I wondered what the
white light could be that was reflected on the
ceiling. Then I looked out of the window, and
what a scene it was! The whole earth, so far
as the eye could see, was one vast fairyland of
snow; moreover, the face of creation appeared
to have risen three or four feet nearer the bedroom
window since last I had looked out, though
the full import of this did not occur to me at the
moment. I could merely look and look at the
wonderful transformation that had been effected
so rapidly and so silently while we slept. All
trace of the garden had disappeared; shrubs and
trees alike were bowed down with billows of
snow. In the more exposed places, the wind
had blown some of the snow from the firs and
larches, but for the most part the trees on the
hillside were as laden with snow as those in
the garden. We might have been high up in
the Alps. The sun was trying to shine, and
bringing a gleam and glint out of every snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
crystal, but the sky still looked leaden in the
north.</p>

<p>Eileen, bringing the morning tea, imparted
the thrilling intelligence that the snow was
several feet deep outside the doors, the outhouses
inaccessible.</p>

<p>“Then we must clear the snow from the
path ourselves,” I said. “There is nothing else
for it.” The handy man was laid up with
influenza in his home several fields away. And
there was small likelihood of any other man
coming our way. But the question of a few
shovels of snow did not seem a serious matter;
we were quite lighthearted about it.</p>

<p>When we made our first survey of the
situation, however, we found that the snow was
far higher outside the door than we had at first
imagined. Owing to the position of the house,
and the way it nestles back in a little hollow
that has been cut out of the hillside to give it
level standing room, special inducement had
been offered to the snow to pile itself up in
drifts and block each door in a most effectual
manner. Still—that snow had to be cleared
away somehow, and we stood in the doorway
and discussed methods.</p>

<p>Hitherto I had always held the idea that
people who allowed themselves to remain
“snowed up” were very dull-witted and lacking
in enterprise. Why not start clearing from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
inside, beginning with the spadeful nearest the
doorstep, and so go on clearing, space after
space, until they had got through to the outer
world? To me it seemed quite an easy thing to
do if you went about it systematically. But one
slight detail had never occurred to me, viz., what
should be done with the first spadeful of snow
when you shovelled it up from beside the doorstep,
to say nothing of the next and the next!
That was one of the questions that bothered us
now, though it was not the first difficulty we
encountered.</p>

<p>At the very outset, of course, we all said,
“Just get a spade!” But, alas, the spade was
locked up in one of the inaccessible outhouses!
Next we called for a broom, but all brooms were
in the same building. Then I said, “Well,
bring some shovels.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the kitchen shovel,” said Eileen
(Ursula pounced on that at once), “and here’s
the scoop from the coal-scuttle, and here’s one
of the small brass shovels from upstairs.”</p>

<p>“But where is the big iron shovel?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That’s in the coal-shed” (likewise inaccessible!).
Virginia turned a deaf ear on the bedroom
shovel, and possessed herself of the scoop.
I had no alternative but to start work with the
small brass affair that was about as effective as a
fish-slice would have been!</p>

<p>We each shovelled up a mass (most of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
tumbling off the shovel again before we got it
into mid-air), and then we looked at each other
and enquired what we were to do with it. It
did not seem advisable to carry it inside the
house; and the only alternative was to toss it a
foot or two away from us; but then, that only
meant adding to the pile already there, which in
any case we should have to clear away before we
could get anywhere! It <i>was</i> a problem.</p>

<p>In the end we managed to clear about a
square foot, and make a few small burrows in
the mound around us, by throwing the snow as
far away as we could each time. But what was
that foot! We were still yards away from the
coal-shed and the wood-house, with only a
limited supply indoors, and still further away
from the water. We had been working for a
solid hour, and seemed to have raised a haystack
of snow a little way off, where we had tossed our
meagre shovelfuls. And then—as though to
mock our feeble attempts—down came the snow
again, and covered up the space we had cleared
with such effort!</p>

<p>We looked at it in absolute despair.</p>

<p>“Why was I born an unmarried spinster?”
exclaimed Ursula. “Oh, that a man would
hove in sight—or whatever the present tense of
‘hove’ may be.”</p>

<p>But no man obligingly hove in response!</p>

<h2>X<br />

<small>Footprints</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> snow was meaning to have a good time of
it; there was no question about that. Further
work in the clearing line was obviously impossible.</p>

<p>Virginia tilted up her coal-scoop in the porch,
beside the pathetic remains of small brass shovel
No. 1 (which broke in half quite early in the
proceedings), and small brass shovel No. 2
(which also was giving wobbly indications of
impending collapse). Ursula, possessing the
only serviceable tool in the whole collection,
had with unusual forethought carried in the
kitchen shovel, and hidden it surreptitiously—realising
that it was a much-coveted treasure at
that moment.</p>

<p>But she did suggest that if we just took the
ladder upstairs and let it down out of the end
bedroom window she could climb down, and
that would bring her close to the wood shed;
she could get from the roof of that on to a low
wall, and walk along the wall to the gate, which
she would then climb over (as it was blocked
each side with snow), and in this way she could
get out into the lane to the spring of water, and
bring back a can of water by the same route.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
This she would tie to a cord let down from the
bedroom window, which could then be hauled
up. Then she would get into the wood shed—which
would not be difficult, as the door opened
inwards, and would not be blocked by the snow
on the inside; getting together some logs, she
would next lash them up so that they also could
be hauled up like the water; finally, she would
herself return, <i>viâ</i> the roof and the ladder and
the bedroom window, to the bosom of the
family.</p>

<p>This suggestion was received with gratitude,
only everyone else wanted to take Ursula’s place,
and make the tour instead of her. We pointed
out to her that, as she had already meanly
annexed the only workable shovel, she ought at
least to relinquish the rôle of leading lady in this
expedition. We might have wasted much time
in arguing with her had not Eileen reminded us
that the ladder—like everything else we needed—was
up the garden safely snowed up under the
laurel hedge. So that project fell through.</p>

<p>“We may as well leave that collection of old
metal in the porch,” said Virginia, “since there
is no fear of callers arriving and putting us to the
blush this afternoon.” Then there was nothing
left to do but to stamp off the snow, and shed
rubbers, and ulsters, and scarfs, and woollen
gloves, and possess our souls in patience indoors,
till such time as the snow should give over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“And to think how I’ve always prided
myself on going away from home prepared for
<i>every</i> emergency!” sighed Virginia. “My
dressing-case is simply crammed with such
valuable data as a bandage for a possible sprained
ankle, court plaster, a pocket-knife with a corkscrew
on it, a specially strong smelling-bottle for
fainty ones, a nightlight, a box of matches,
ammoniated quinine, wedges for rattling windows,
a box of tin-tacks—no, not a hammer, I
always use the heel of my shoe—a two-foot rule—what
should I want that for? I’m sure I
don’t know, but then you never can tell! But
with all my precautions, it never occurred to me
to pack a spade and broom in with my luggage.
This snowstorm has shown me the weak points
in my outfit.”</p>

<p>“It has shown <i>me</i> the weak points in my
joints,” groaned Ursula. “And, moreover, I
never knew before how many parts of us there
were that could ache. I’m just painful from
head to foot. I never realised what a noble,
self-sacrificing calling snow-shovelling is. And
when I think of the men who come round in
town, offering to sweep the snow from the path—and
a good long path too—for a few pence, it
seems a positive scandal that they should get so
little. I’m sure there is quite ten shillings’
worth of me used up already!”</p>

<p>We certainly did ache. And only those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
have been suddenly called upon to attack a bank
of snow, with inexperience and feeble tools, can
know the extent of our stiffness. We were
content to let it snow, without the slightest
desire to crick our backs any further. And after
all there is something exceedingly restful and
soothing to over-worked brain and over-strained
nerves, in merely sitting in a low chair by a
roaring fire, taking only such exercise as is
required to put on an extra log, secure in the
knowledge that neither telegram, nor visitor,
nor any communication whatsoever from the
outside world can possibly break in upon the
quiet and peace. You need to spend your life
in the heart of the great metropolis, amid the
never-ceasing turmoil of London streets, with
your days one long maddening distraction of
callers, telephone bells, endless queries and
perpetual noise, to appreciate the joy of the
solitude in that snowed-up cottage among the
hills.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For long months and months the guns in
Flanders had sent a muffled boom over my
London garden every hour of the day, and had
shaken my windows violently every hour of the
night; and there is no need to set down in
writing the ache and the anxiety that each dull
thud brought to the heart. Every one who has
husband or brother or son out yonder knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
what question comes wafted over each time the
guns send out their deadly roll.</p>

<p>But our craving for quiet was not a desire to
get out of earshot of the guns. It dated farther
back than the War; it was the inevitable outcome
of the over-wrought hurry of the twentieth
century, when one’s nerves get so frazzled in the
vain attempt to do everything, and do it all at
once, that at last life is simply one intense longing
for that “nest in the wilderness” out of reach
of the clamour of the market-place and the
vain, foolish, soul-wearing struggle for material
things.</p>

<p>In that enchanted period of life, known as
“before the War,” we used often to discuss the
desirability of moving to an uninhabited island
and spending the rest of our days there in unalloyed
peace. It had been an absorbing dream
with me, ever since I first read Sarah Orne
Jewett’s book, <i>The Country of the Pointed Firs</i>.
I dare say it was selfish to think of being <i>quite</i>
out of reach of the noise and dirt and bustle and
din of cities, and where there would be no next-door
piano, and no gramophone in the house the
other side, and no soots floating in the windows—but
it was a very pleasant one, and I used to
add to it occasionally by imagining what it would
be like to wake up one morning and find that
some unknown but generous friend had left me
an uninhabited island as a legacy; one not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
from the mainland, and somewhere around the
British Isles, of course.</p>

<p>When such a thing happens, it will find me
quite prepared, for we have built the house there,
and furnished it, and mapped out our life there
many and many a time; all I am waiting for is—the
island! That seems hard to come by!
I’ve had one or two offered me (not as gifts, but
to purchase), like Lundy, for instance, but they
cost too much and are not uninhabited. So we
have still to content ourselves with plans only.</p>

<p>We were recalled to The Island (we always
refer to it in capital letters) as we sat round the
fire, by Virginia inquiring what books I should
take with me when I moved there. She said
she concluded that, being a booky sort of a
person, a library would be an essential.</p>

<p>But I set my face firmly against taking unnecessary
literature. My house gets choked
with books, ninety per cent. of which I never
open a second time. I am for ever turning them
out, and yet they go on accumulating. Virginia
has a perfect mania for hoarding impossible
books, that she could never find time to read
through again if she lived to be the age of
Methuselah; yet she keeps them all, on the
chance that some day she may require to refer
to a solitary sentence in one of them. Her
cupboards are full, and her shelves are packed
behind and before, and she has had sets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
drawers made just to hold “papers”; which
means hundredweights of abstruse pamphlets,
and learned magazines, and cuttings—well, I
dare say you know the sort of girl she is, and
what it’s like when their flat gets spring-cleaned,
and she insists that no one must lay a finger on
<i>her</i> books!</p>

<p>Ursula isn’t much better; but at least she is
more practical, and believes in spring cleaning;
hence, in <i>her</i> case, she does have a turn-out occasionally,
and just throws away indiscriminately
whole shelf-loads of books in a fit of desperation,
when she has managed to get every article in the
flat jumbled up in a heap in the room it has no
business in, and no one can find anything. I
believe at such time she surreptitiously disposes
of some of Virginia’s tomes, too; but this I only
suspect. At any rate, Virginia is always bewailing
a number of “<i>most</i> important books”
that never can be found after one of Ursula’s
domestic upheavals.</p>

<p>Knowing all this, I said that only a definite
number of books would be allowed on The
Island. Both girls said it would be impossible
to fix any limit that would meet the case. I
said I was quite sure humanity, more especially
the intellectual feminine portion of it, could do
with far less books than they thought they could.</p>

<p>Vehement protests!</p>

<p>Then I suggested, to prove my words, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
we should each start to make out a list of the
books we couldn’t possibly do without on The
Island—<i>only</i> those we couldn’t possibly do without—and
see what it amounted to. “Jot down
any book or author that occurs to us as being
essential, irrespective of any sort of classification,”
I said. “And we had better compare
notes every ten books, as we go along.”</p>

<p>Forthwith, we each scribbled down our first
ten <i>absolutely indispensable</i> books (they were to
be exclusive of religious and devotional works).
When we compared notes in a few minutes’
time, these were our lists:—</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginia.</span></div>


<ul class="booklist"><li>Encyclopædia.</li>
<li>A Dictionary.</li>

<div class="center"><br /><span class="smcap">Ursula.</span></div>


<ul class="booklist">
<li>A good Guide to London.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>A large selection of Needlework and Crochet Books.</li>

<li>All my Cookery Books.</li>
<li>All the Board of Agriculture’s Leaflets.</li>
<li>A Book on Deer Culture.</li></ul>



<p>Of course, we each gazed in profound surprise
and contempt on the others’ lists, and asked why
this and that had been put down. Why did
Ursula want a guide to London, when the object
of going to The Island was to get away from
London?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>She said she thought you ought to keep in
touch with things even if you were away; and if
it came to that, why did I want a Deer book,
since I couldn’t look at venison?</p>

<p>I said I felt it in me that I should start
keeping deer as soon as I landed, and there was
more sense in doing that than in reading a Time
Table, for instance!</p>

<p>Virginia protested a Time Table was absolutely
essential, else how would you ever be able
to get away when you wanted to? And you
never knew <i>when</i> you might be summoned to
anyone’s funeral in a hurry, and was she supposed
to be cut off from <i>all</i> human enjoyment?
Whereas no one could possibly want a Student’s
Song Book, when they couldn’t sing two notes in
tune; and, also, why Mrs. Hemans, might she
venture to ask?</p>

<p>“Yes, who would dream of carting around a
Mrs. Hemans in these days?” I scoffed.</p>

<p>“The frontispiece engraving of Mrs. Hemans
always reminded me of mother’s Aunt Matilda,”
said Ursula impressively. “I only saw her
twice, but on the first occasion she gave me a
doll, and on the second a blue and white bead
necklace; I’ve got three of the beads left, in my
workbox. And I’ve always loved beads, and I
loved her in consequence, and I wouldn’t dream
of being parted from Mrs. Hemans. And, in
any case, why bring a Dictionary?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because I may require to look up a more
expressive word occasionally, or enlarge my flow
of vocabulary,” Virginia explained. “And I
conclude I’m not expected to be absolutely dumb
when we get there!”</p>

<p>Of course, I don’t mean to imply that these
are necessarily the books we should have named
had we sat down thoughtfully to compile a list
most representative of our tastes and needs; but
whatever list I had made, I’m sure I should have
included the volumes I named; and it goes to
show that the books that make an individual
appeal to us are not necessarily those that our
friends expect us to name.</p>

<p>The library catalogue was never completed,
for, before we had time further to criticize each
other’s preferences, we were pulled up short by
a sound.</p>

<p>We all stopped our chatter on an instant, for
surely and certainly there could be no mistaking
it, there was the ring of an iron spade
chinking on stone! When last we had looked
out, just after breakfast, not a stone had been
visible for a spade to chink against in the
whole vicinity. We flew to the door, and there,
touching his hat with a smiling “Good morning,
ma’am,” stood the elderly handy man who ought
to have been in bed with his bad cold; and
behold, a clear path to the lane. He had worked
from the gate inwards, and we had been so busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with our discussions indoors, we had not heard
him till he reached the porch.</p>

<p>“I was only able to get down downstairs
yesterday,” the invalid explained. “But in any
case it wasn’t no good coming over till that spell
o’ snow was down, even if I’d been fit to come
out.” Then, after a detailed description of
symptoms and sufferings and so forth—“Yes, I
think there’s a good bit more to come down yet.
Nothing won’t be able to be got up from the
village yet awhile; they tell me the drifts is
eight feet deep in places. Maybe in a few days
I’ll be able to get down. I’ll be wanting some
sharps soon myself for the fowls, so I’ll have to
try and get down by the end of the week. And
the butcher’s killing himself this week, I could
bring you up a j’int. I’ve knocked up a good
bit of kindling wood in the wood shed, so you’ll
be all right now.”</p>

<p>Yes, we were all right now, from one point
of view; but I devoutly hoped he would not
wait till the end of the week before he went for
those “sharps,” for I had discovered that we had
<i>only one loaf in the house!</i> And as they only
bake twice a week in our village, and everyone
knows how long war bread won’t keep, I need
only add that already we had to cut off all the
outside before bringing it to table, and by
to-morrow it would be quite gorgonzola-ish right
through!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as he had gone, Ursula burst forth,
“Don’t talk to me any more of the rights of
women”—no one had been, but we let it pass—“don’t
tell me they are the equals of men, and
that all they want is a good education and scope
for their energies. Look at us, haven’t <i>we</i> all
had good educations?” (Ursula and her sister
are thoroughly acquainted with the literature of
several European countries; they read Plato in
the original; and can give you reliable information
on such points as the similarity between the
tribes on the borders of Tibet and the Patagonians—if
any exists. They can certainly be
called well educated.) “And wasn’t there scope
enough for our energies out there? And then
consider what we accomplished! While a man
like that comes along—says he never went to
school in his life, just risen from a sick bed, too,
so none too strong—yet in an hour or so he’s
done what <i>we</i> should not have got through in a
month. And look at the neat job he’s made of
it, with the snow banked up trimly on each side;
why, we were about as effective and as artistic
as three fowls scratching on the surface of things.
And then look at the stack of wood he got ready
in no time. I’m sure I blushed to see him
gazing at that collection of decrepit shovels
standing in the porch——”</p>

<p>“And well you might blush,” edged in Virginia,
“remembering how you selfishly stuck to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the only decent shovel there was, with never so
much as an offer to either of us to have a turn.”</p>

<p>“—Yes, we ought to have votes, we’re so—capable!”
Ursula went on, but I begged her not
to worry her head about votes just now, as the
question of food was of greater national importance.</p>

<p>At the word “food” of course everyone was
all attention, and we made ourselves into a Privy
Council, and they appointed me Food Controller,
because it would give them the right to do all
the grumbling. But the matter was not quite
as much of a joke as they thought. For so long
they had been accustomed to a pantry stocked
with bottles and tins and stores of all descriptions
(and Virginia once remarked that to read
the labels alone—if you had lost the tin-opener—was
quite as good as a seven-course meal at a
fashionable restaurant), that they forgot things
were not like that now! In the dairy, too
(which we use as a larder), it was the usual pre-war
thing to see large open jam tarts in deep
dishes, with a fancy trellis work over the top of
the jam, and large pies with lovely water-lilies,
made from the scraps of paste, on top, and
spicy brown cakes, with a delicious odour,
standing on the stone slabs—Abigail being a
capital hand at pastry and cakes. The dairy is
built on the north side, close under the hill, and
the great stone wall that keeps the hill from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
tumbling down on top of the dairy is packed with
hart’s-tongue and the British maiden-hair fern,
and rosettes of the pretty little scaly spleenwort,
and lacy tufts of wall rue, and practically every
other kind of fern that loves damp shade and the
English climate. And ivy runs over the lot
right up to the top, where wild roses and honeysuckle
and blackberry ramp about in the sunshine,
and often peep down to see how it fares
with their comrades in the cool ravine below.
The long fronds of the fern wave in at the dairy
window, and the ivy sends out little fingers,
catching hold wherever it can, and creeping in,
very much at home, through the wire-netting
that does duty for a window. My guests always
like to go into the dairy to see the wonderful
array of ferns; but I sometimes suspect it is also
to gaze on the appetizing-looking things that
appeal irresistibly to all who have spent an hour
or two in our hungry air!</p>

<p>But war had made a considerable difference
alike to pantry and store-cupboard and larder,
and we had to trust to the promise of Miss
Jarvis, the lady at the village shop—and one of
the most valuable members of the community—that
we should not actually starve! As the stocks
had been used, they had not been replenished.
Cinnamon buns, lemon-curd cheese cakes, fruit
cakes with a nice crack in the top, were no
longer piled up in the larder. No home-cured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
ham, sewn up in white muslin, hung from the
big hook in the kitchen ceiling. No large, dried,
golden-coloured vegetable marrows hung up
beside it for winter use.</p>

<p>We had plenty of potatoes, fortunately (and
never had we valued potatoes as we did this
year!), and we had the usual “remains” that
are in the larder, when the butcher has not
called for a few days and a family lives from
hand to mouth, as one has had to do recently,
lest one should be suspected of hoarding!</p>

<p>There was a tin of lunch biscuits, some
cheese, and cereals; but the rest of the store
cupboard seemed exasperatingly useless when it
came to sustaining life in a snow-bound household.
What good was a tin of linseed, for
instance, or a bottle of cayenne, or a bottle of
evaporated horse-radish (with the sirloin presumably
still gambolling about somewhere in
the valley)? Why had I ever laid in a bottle of
tarragon vinegar, a bottle of salad dressing, a
box of rennet tablets, a tin of curry powder,
desiccated cocoanut, a bottle of chutney? Even
the tin of baking powder and the nutmegs and
capers seemed extravagant and superfluous. Oh,
for a simple glass of tongue—but we had opened
our only one the day we arrived!</p>

<p>One thing was certain: while the snow
remained at its present depth, to say nothing of
an increase, no provisions could be got up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the village. The steep roads were like glass the
last time we were out; now they would be
impassable for horses or vehicles, even though a
man might manage to get over them somehow.
Milk we could obtain from a neighbouring farm,
perhaps a few eggs, possibly a fowl as a very
special favour, now that our path was cleared;
but that was the utmost we could hope to raise
locally. The point to be considered was: How
long could we hold out?</p>

<p>“Well, there is only one other thing I can
think of,” said Virginia; “you must fly signals of
distress, and hoist a flag up at the top of the
chimney—they always do in books.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How
are you to get the flag up the chimney? I’m
sure <i>I</i> don’t know if you don’t! What’s the good
of being an editor if you don’t know a simple
little thing like that?”</p>

<p>But the problem was solved for me by a tap
at the door, and then one realised the superiority
of the servants of the Crown over all ordinary
individuals. It was the postman. He said
“Good morning” with the modest air of one
who knows he has accomplished a great deed,
but leaves it for others to extol.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought up the letters,” he said; “but
I couldn’t get up the parcels to-day. There are
a good many.” I knew what that meant. My
post is necessarily a very heavy one, more
especially when I am away from town, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
great packages of things are sent down daily.
“Is there anything I can take back with me?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>I hastily scribbled some telegrams on urgent
matters, glad of this chance to get them sent
off; and I knew the Head of Affairs would be
glad to hear we were all well. As I handed
them to the man, he rather hesitatingly produced
a bulky newspaper parcel that had been
hidden under his big mackintosh cape, with an
apologetic look, as it were, to the Crown, that
the garment should have been put to so unofficial
an use. Then in an undertone, lest the
Postmaster-General in London might overhear,
he said—</p>

<p>“Miss Jarvis was afraid you might be
running short of things.” The thoughtful Lady
of the Village Shop had sent up a loaf, a piece
of bacon and a pound of sugar. How I blessed
her!</p>

<p>Next day he managed to get up some of the
small postal packages. The first one I opened
was from one of the Assistant Editors in town.</p>

<p>“I see in the papers that you’ve had a heavy
fall of snow,” she wrote, “and as there was not
a solitary line from you this morning, I’m
wondering if you are isolated? At any rate,
I’m sending you a home-made cake and a box
of smoked sausages by this post (instead of
MSS.) in case you may be cut off from supplies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“If that isn’t bed-rock common sense,” said
Ursula. “Most intelligent girls would have
improved the occasion by sending you newspaper
cuttings with statistics of the latest submarine
sinkings, to keep your spirits up.”</p>

<p>Another slight fall of snow was all the late
afternoon brought us, not enough to spoil the
newly cleared path, but sufficient to reveal the
fact next morning that someone with large
masculine boots had been promenading round
the cottage, for there were the footprints, a clear
track that even a detective could not have failed
to see, leading from the gate to the outhouses,
from the outhouses to the scullery door, from
the scullery door to the best door (it’s absurd to
call it the front door, because each side is as
much the front as the other excepting the part
that backs into the hill!), from the best door to
the door with the porch, and so on, out of the
gate again.</p>

<p>As none of us knew anything about them,
we concluded the handy man must have returned,
bent on some new errand of mercy. But he
disowned them; had not been near the place
since the previous forenoon, and the snow had
not fallen till five o’clock. It looked exceedingly
queer, not to say uncanny, and we recalled
the fact that the dog had barked violently after
we were in bed. So far as I knew, there was
no resident on those hills who would think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
wandering round the house after dark; and no
tramp or odd wayfarer would ever scale those
heights unless he had some very urgent reason
for so doing, and had a definite destination. It
is too stiff a climb to take on a casual chance of
picking up anything; moreover, unless a man
knew his way, he would soon lose himself.
Though the footprints really perplexed me, I did
not say very much about them; but Eileen did.</p>

<p>When Mr. Jones from a neighbouring farm
arrived with milk, I heard the full description
being given him at the kitchen door. He
expressed due interest, and described a mysterious
case he had just read about, in the
weekly paper, of a servant who had disappeared
from a house in London where she had been in
service for years, and no trace of her had been
found since. Eileen and he agreed as to the
many points of similarity between the two
cases.</p>

<p>When the lad from the butcher’s came to
know what portion I wished to bespeak of the
sheep they would be killing, come Friday, I
heard Eileen once more going through the story
of the footprints, combined with details of the
missing domestic. He, in turn, told her how a
burglar had been one morning in a house next
door to his grandmother’s in Bristol, and how,
when they chased him, he jumped right over the
garden wall, into the very dish of potatoes his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
aunt was peeling for his dinner. (The pronouns
were confusing, but I don’t think it was for the
burglar’s dinner the potatoes were intended.)</p>

<p>The farmer’s daughter who came to inquire
if I would like a fowl, after hearing the story,
offered to lend Eileen a novelette she had just
been reading, where there were footprints exactly
like these; and in the last chapter it turns out
that the footprints were those of—I forget who
or what, but it was very enthralling, and Eileen
gratefully jumped at the offer of the loan.</p>

<p>The old man who came to say that they
couldn’t deliver any coals till the weather broke,
remarked that he didn’t like the look of it at all,
and said he should be quite nervous if he were
she, and asked her if she had heard about the
old woman who had been found dead in her
bed in Yorkshire, died of cold, and fifty golden
sovereigns tied up in the middle of her pillow?
Eileen had not heard of it. The old man said it
was as well to keep your eyes open, as there
were funny people in the world, and this seemed
to him just such another affair.</p>

<p>And much more to the same effect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night I was suddenly awakened by a
sound, though at first I could not tell what it
was. I lay wide awake, holding my breath:
then it came again, a gentle rasp, rasp, as though
someone were scraping something with a metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
tool. At the same moment I heard Virginia
and Ursula stirring in the next room. I stole in
to them; they too were listening. And then
we realised that the burglar had really come!
From the direction of the sound we knew he
was scraping away the putty, or something of
the sort, from a pane of glass that was let into
the scullery door. If he managed to get through
that, he could undo the bolt, and would be free
of the place.</p>

<p>What were we to do, we asked each other in
whispers? Of course, previously, I had always
known what I should do if a burglar ever came
to my house. I should go downstairs, throw
open the door and confront him unafraid, asking
him in a firm but most melodious voice what
had brought him to such a low moral depth, and
urging him to better things. He would be so
undone by the sight of me and the sound of the
music of my voice, that he would crumple up
at my feet and confess all his past burglaries.
Whereupon, I should motion him to come in
and take a seat, while I hastily prepared a cup
of Bovril, and cut him a large plate of cold roast
beef; and on his observing that I had passed
him the mustard pot without first removing the
silver spoon, he would be so overcome by my
confidence in him that he would voluntarily vow
to turn over a new leaf. He would leave with
half-a-crown in his pocket. And years afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
a prosperous man would knock at my
door, bearing in his hand half-a-crown, etc.</p>

<p>But this particular case did not seem to fit in
with my previous programme for the reception
of burglars. In the first place there was no
Bovril in the house; and secondly, there was no
beef, only a tiny piece of cold mutton in the
larder—and you can’t do anything heroic with
only cold mutton.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the man was scraping away downstairs,
and we did not know but what he would
be in upon us any moment.</p>

<p>“Shall we let the dog loose?” said Virginia.</p>

<p>“The dog!” I repeated. “Why, where <i>is</i>
the dog? Why isn’t he barking?” Until
that moment we had forgotten him entirely.
There was no sound of him below; and he is a
ferocious little thing if strangers come anywhere
near the place.</p>

<p>“Oh, then they’ve poisoned him!” gasped
Ursula, almost in tears. “They’ve got some
poisoned meat in to him somehow, under the
door perhaps, and he’ll be lying there a corpse,
and we never thinking of him.” We all three
crept as silently as we could downstairs, to find
“the corpse” remarkably cheerful, with his nose
at the crack of an outer door, every hair of his
body on end with tension, his ears cocked up,
and every muscle of him on the alert—but not a
ghost of a bark did he give, only a perfunctory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
waggle of his tail, just as an acknowledgment of
our presence, and an apology that he was too
much engaged at the moment to give us more
attention. There was not much poison about
that dog! As the scraping got louder, and my
teeth were chattering violently (but only with
the cold, as I explained to the other two), I fled
upstairs again, and they followed.</p>

<p>“What <i>do</i> you usually do when burglars
come?” whispered Virginia.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’ve never had one before,”
I moaned.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you once tell me you had a bell, or
something of the sort?” said Ursula.</p>

<p>“Why, yes; I had forgotten that.” I keep
a huge bell under the bed at the head, and I
always intended to ring it violently out of the
window if a burglar ever came. (Scrape, scrape,
scrape, continued down below.) “I don’t suppose
anyone on these hills would wake up to
listen; but, at any rate, it might worry the
burglar and send him off.”</p>

<p>“Let’s ring it now,” said Virginia eagerly,
“and then, when he is well <i>outside</i> the gate, of
course, we’ll let the dog run out after him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I agreed. “But first I want to
go into Eileen’s room, and peep out of her
window and see <i>who</i> is below. Her window
is just over the scullery door, and is always
open at night. If it is anyone from the district—though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
I don’t believe it is—I should recognise
him.”</p>

<p>So we tip-toed into Eileen’s room, where she
lay sound asleep.</p>

<p>“When I give the signal, you ring,” I said.</p>

<p>Cautiously, slowly, silently, I got my head a
little further and further out of the window,
shaking with ague from head to foot. And there
I saw the burglar—he was Farmer Jones’s dog
(alias the wolf, you remember), and he had got
hold of a sardine tin that had been emptied that
day. He was having a lovely time, licking that
tin out, and as he licked, so it scraped and
scraped on the stones. No wonder my own dog
did not bark; he knew it was his ancient enemy
without, and the instinct of the dog of war was
to wait stealthily till the foe should get within
his reach.</p>

<p>“Don’t ring the bell!” I whispered
hoarsely, and we crept out of the room.</p>

<p>“I think it’s just as well Eileen did not
wake,” I said, as we made ourselves a midnight
cup of tea before turning in again, “for I’ve no
desire to hear <i>this</i> episode being related all day
long at the kitchen door!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Have you ever sat by the fire indoors, when
the ground has been covered with snow, and the
sky grey and heavy, till you have been “absolutely
<i>perished</i> with the cold,” and then someone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
has come and dragged you out (or, if you have
wonderfully uncommon sense, you have dragged
yourself out), and plunged right into it—a
shrivelled-up martyr! After ten minutes spent
in trying to sweep the snow from the path, what
have you felt like?</p>

<p>I plunged right out into it—simply because
the two girls were bragging such a deal about
their own heroic fortitude in forsaking the fireside
at the call of life’s stern duties, or something
like that. But first of all I put on a knitted
hug-me-tight; then my leather motoring undercoat;
then my big cloth coat; and finally, my
mackintosh. I tied on a woollen sports cap
with a winter motor scarf; I turned up my coat
collar, and put on a fur necklet; and, of course,
I didn’t forget gaiters and warm gloves.</p>

<p>Then I stood on the doorstep and looked out—if
you believe me, the cold went right through
me, and fairly rattled my bones inside.</p>

<p>Still, I wasn’t going to be outdone in misery
by the other two, and noticing that the bushes
were actually breaking down under the load of
snow, I seized a broom and sallied forth. After
all, if one has to die a martyr’s death, one may
as well occupy the final moments in doing useful
kindnesses for one’s family.</p>

<p>It is some sort of solace to picture how they
will eventually say, “To think of her doing all
that, when——”; or, “To the last she never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
gave in; why only the very day——!”;
or, “Ah! how often have I seen the poor
dear——!” etc.</p>

<p>So I made for the pink rhododendron, that
was suffering badly; being evergreen, its large
rosettes of leaves, surrounding each flower-bud
of the future, had caught and held great masses
of snow; the lower branches were literally buried
beneath the heavy drifts.</p>

<p>But as I found I couldn’t get at it without
clearing a way through a three-foot bank of
snow, I set to work with a spade. It sounds
simple enough, I know; but unless you’ve been
getting your living at snow-clearing, you would
never believe what a lot there is to it, when you
start to make a nice serviceable path through
a drift from two to three feet deep, and six feet
long.</p>

<p>I reached the pink rhododendron at last.
Getting my broom against a main stem, I shook
it gently. What a lovely shower came down!
I don’t know that I needed it all over me,
personally; nor was it necessary to choke up
half the cutting I had just made. Still, down it
came, white billows and a rain of silver powder.
I never knew what snow was really like, till I
shook it all over me, and the sun suddenly came
out and turned the cascade to a gleaming white
radiance.</p>

<p>Having got well smothered to start with, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
decided I might just as well go on; and that I
could dispense with the motor undercoat, which
I left hanging on the bush. Lower down the
garden I could hear the clink and scrape of
shovel and spade against the stones, as the other
two cleared the snow from the various little
flights of rough stone steps that take you up or
down, from one level of the garden to another.
But I didn’t feel like clearing steps just then;
it was too niggly. I wanted something bigger
than that, and I somehow had a desire to work
alone, so I struck a path that went up the
garden, and began to work my way towards the
top gate, clearing as I went.</p>

<p>As I bent over the smooth glistening surface,
I was amazed to see the number of messages
written there for those who know the language
of the wilds well enough to read them! What
a scurrying to and fro of little feet had been
going on since the snowfall, all on the one quest—food
and water! Birds innumerable had left
their signatures; some I knew, some I could not
identify, save that they were birds. Rabbits I
could trace; stoats, too, might have made some
of the writing in the snow; and there were
bigger tracks—perhaps a fox.</p>

<p>Everywhere there were tidings of other wayfarers,
other workers, other seekers—the many
other dwellers who have their homes somewhere
between the larch-woods and the weir. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
moment before the place had seemed a frost-locked,
deserted, uninhabitable waste of snow;
now I saw it was teeming with life, brave, persistent,
not-to-be-daunted life, that in spite of
cold and hardship and privation and a universal
stoppage of supplies, still set out, with unquenchable
faith, on the quest for the food
which they have learnt to know is invariably
forthcoming, “in due season.”</p>

<p>The surprising thing to me is the fact that
such small bodies can ever survive such a welter
of snow. Aren’t they afraid they will sink down
and be swallowed up in it? Have they no fear
lest they lose their way, with the old landmarks
obliterated? Doesn’t it strike terror to the
heart when they find their doorway blocked, and
themselves snowed up in burrow or hole? Yet,
judging by outside evidence, it would seem that
none of these things daunt them; an obstacle is
merely something to be surmounted.</p>

<p>To my mind the most pathetic thing about
it all is the fact that their chief fear seems to be
fear of human beings, a dread of the very ones
who could, and ought to, befriend them.</p>

<p>In my clearing I moved a small wooden box
that had been used for seedlings, and since had
lain unnoticed beside a hedge. Underneath a
tiny field mouse had taken refuge. It seemed
almost paralysed with terror when I suddenly
lifted the box, and escape was blocked on every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
side by banks of snow. The poor little thing
just sat up on its hind legs and looked at me
most pitifully. I can’t say that I exactly cultivate
mice, in an ordinary way, but—here was a
fellow-creature in distress, such a little one too;
I couldn’t have refused its appeal. I quickly
put the box over it again, and clearing a space
by the hole it had used as a door, I put down
some bird-seed—I always carry something in
my coat pocket for the birds—and I went away.
Ten minutes later, every bit was gone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Working my way round to another thicket
of rhododendrons, that is a bank of purple and
creamy white in June, once more I sent the
silver-dust flying with my trusty broom. As one
great mass came hurtling down, it so deluged
me that for the moment I had to hold my breath,
shut my eyes, and clutch on to a branch to keep
myself from being buried under it. And then I
heard a tragic whimper.</p>

<p>Turning round, I saw the small white dog,
shaking himself out of the mass—and such a
dingy-dirty object his <i>passé</i> white coat looked
against the snow! I had left him indoors, a
melancholy little figure, very sorry for himself,
by reason of a swelled face. He will persist in
lying with his nose to the bottom crack of the
back door, irrespective of wind or weather, ever
hopeful that a hare or a fox may come trailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
by; and then—oh joy! what a turmoil there is
within (he quite fancies he is “baying”), and
what a scurrying of fur and feet without!</p>

<p>Having got him in, and rubbed him down,
and wrapped him up in his favourite bit of old
blanket, and given him a bone (which he couldn’t
eat, poor little chap, but he had it in his basket
with him, against such times as his mouth was
in working order again), I returned to the garden—you
couldn’t have kept me out of it now! I
found I didn’t need the hug-me-tight, however,
and I left it on the orchard gate.</p>

<p>What a work it was, tumbling over stone
edgings one forgot were there, tripping over tree
trunks and logs—the whole place seemed strewn
with obstacles one never noticed until the snow
covered them over.</p>

<p>I picked myself up continually, and worked on
with my broom. Virginia came up once to point
out to me my appalling lack of scientific method;
but as I have never had any illusions on this
point, it didn’t worry me. Ursula volunteered
the information that I looked like Don Quixote
tilting at a windmill, each time I attacked a
bush or tree. I knew she was merely jealous of
my ability. I’m not one to let a little thing
like that deter me from my course of well-doing.
I merely took off my fur necklet and thick
motor scarf, and left them on a stile, so sunburnt
was I getting beneath them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>And how grateful even the dry cracking
twigs of the rose bushes seemed to be for the
lifting of the load that bowed down one and all.
The hollies had been trying bravely to hold up
their heads, but it was hard work; every leaf
had held out a little curved hand to catch a few
snowflakes as they fell, and the total result was
a mound that threatened to break the trees to
pieces. They, too, shook themselves cheerfully,
when I relieved them of their burden.</p>

<p>I could not do much to help the lesser
plants; they were mostly buried beneath the
snow, and I hoped they were the warmer in
consequence. The poor wallflowers, that had
been so sprightly with opening yellow buds when
we arrived, now showed only shrivelled branches
above the snow.</p>

<p>As I broomed my way towards the vegetable
garden, I noticed that the birds were gathering
near—they had kept away before, while the dog
was about. But now the starlings began to
shriek from the roof of the big barn. “Look at
her! Look at her! What’s the use of wasting
time on rose trees! No grub’s there! Look at
her! Shaking snow down! Just as though
there wasn’t enough on the ground before!”</p>

<p>“Oh, do be quiet!” shouted back a rook.
“Just look at our nest! It would have been
such an up-to-date affair, too; wife built it on the
new war-economy lines—clever bird my wife is—only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
three sticks, you know; saves waste;
and <i>now</i> look at it! Wife can’t even find the
sticks!”</p>

<p>“Serves her right,” cawed a neighbour (a lady,
I feel sure). “She shouldn’t have started so
early—always trying to get ahead of everyone
else with her spring cleaning!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sun had got the better of the clouds, and
had changed the whole earth from grey to gold,
from dead white to a gleaming brilliance, yellow
in the sunlight, blue—undiluted blue—in the
shade. I had seen blue snow in pictures, and
had hitherto regarded it as an artistic exaggeration.
But now I saw the blue with my own
eyes on the north side of the walls and barns,
and where long shadows were cast by the
Wellingtonia, the hollies, and the evergreen firs.
The mist still hovered over the valleys, and shut
us off from the lower lands, but it was no longer
cold and sombre; indeed, it was no longer mist
at all; it seemed just light enmeshed, a liquid
golden atmosphere.</p>

<p>The snow gleamed and scintillated with its
diamond-dusted surface; the trunks of the Scots
firs surprised one with the sudden warmth of red
they showed when struck by the sunbeams, and
the lovely colour still left in their blue-green
foliage.</p>

<p>Far and wide the birds answered the call of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the sun. Big pinions flew across the sky, casting
shadows on the snow-scape as they passed; small
birds darted in and out of holes in tree trunks, or
crannies under the eaves; there was a cheeping
and a chattering all over the garden and the
orchard; while up and down the larches flitted
the tits—the blue-tits swinging upside down,
almost turning somersaults, as the notion chanced
to take them; the coal-tits, any number of them,
skipping about from branch to branch, never
still a moment, always talking in their brisk
little twitter; while over all there rang incessantly
the “Pinker, pinker, peter, peter,” of the
great-tit.</p>

<p>Near at hand, robin, my little garden companion,
was having a good deal to say. At first
I think he was reiterating what he had often
said before: that he considered the dog a
nuisance that ought to be banished from any
properly conducted garden, since his habit of
chasing every moving object within sight was
disturbing, to say the least of it, to a conscientious
worm-hunter.</p>

<p>Having finished on this subject, he began to
talk about other things; but try as I would, I
could not understand what he said; yet I knew
he was trying to tell me <i>something</i>. He kept
taking short flights over to the wall, and then
back to some branch near at hand. “Twitter,
twitter,” he kept on saying; yet he never even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
noticed the path I was clearing, back he would
fly to the wall.</p>

<p>At last, as he impatiently fluffed out his
feathers, perched on a white currant bush, till he
looked like a ball, saying a lot more the while, I
made my way through the snow to the wall.
He darted after me, and stood on top of a mound
of leaves that had been swept together last
autumn, and left to stand till the spring digging
should start. Being on the south side of the
wall, and sheltered a little by the wide-spreading
branches of a big Spanish chestnut, it had
escaped a good deal of the snow, though it was
frozen hard on the surface.</p>

<p>Here robin stood, and when he saw I was
looking at him, he pecked several times with his
beak at the solid mass. Then he flicked his tail
and gazed at me. “Surely you understand what
I want?” he said with his beady eyes. “No?
Oh! how stupid human beings are! Well,
watch me again!” Dab, dab, dab, went the
small beak once more, without making the
slightest impression on the ice-bound lumps.</p>

<p>Then I grew intelligent.</p>

<p>“Out of the way,” I said to him, and he flew
to a low branch of the tree and watched me
critically, while I drove the spade well into the
mass.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” he chirped out excitedly, as I
turned it over and got down to the softer portion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
spreading the leaves about. “Why on earth
couldn’t you have done that sooner!” as he
swooped down to my very feet and seized something
wriggly—gulp! I looked away.</p>

<p>What ninety-ninth sense is it, I wonder, that
tells birds when food is about? One moment
robin and I had the chestnut tree and its environment
to ourselves. Next moment, directly I
turned away, down came thrushes, and blackbirds,
and starlings; and though robin put his
foot down firmly, said it was all his, every worm
of it, and dared anyone else to touch so much as
a caterpillar-egg, or he’d know the reason why,
he was outdone by numbers, and finally lost
what he might have had because he considered
it his duty to chastise Mr. Over-the-wall-robin,
who had presumed to say that the leaf-heap
belonged to him!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At last I got to the top gate, which is about
one hundred feet higher than the lower part of
the garden. What a wonderful world I gazed
upon, so weird, so immensely mysterious it
looked under the great snow covering. The
valleys where the sun did not penetrate were
entirely blotted out by soft mist. One seemed
to be alone, high up in space, girdled about by
white and grey, gold and mauve and steely-blue;
I wanted to push on and on, to walk
miles and miles, to fly if I could. The fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
was, the exhilaration of the keen pure atmosphere
was already beginning to tell on me, and
was fast mounting to my head.</p>

<p>One thing I caught sight of on the opposite
hills gave me pause for thought: it was a larch-wood
in which every tree was blown so far over
to one side, that there would be but little chance
of their ever recovering or getting into the upright.
I remembered that the handy man had
told us trees were lying in all directions out in
the main road. I decided to climb still higher
up the hill and see what my own woods looked
like. First, however, I took off the big coat,
and left it hanging on the under bough of a
larch inside the gate.</p>

<p>Out of the top gate I went, and along the lane
that now showed a moderately hard path along
the centre, where one and another had trampled
it down. A few yards brought me to a field
that in June is one dazzling, waving mass of
moon daisies, mauve pyramidal orchises, rich
purple orchises, quaking grass, and a hundred
other flowers besides. Not a first class hay-crop,
I admit; still, a fair-sized rick stands in one
corner. And although it may not possess strong
feeding qualities for cattle, this field has wonderful
feeding qualities for mind and soul; I’ve
lived on it many and many a day through dreary
London fogs and amid dirty City pavements and
sordid-looking bricks and mortar. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
town has seemed unendurable, with its noise and
its hustle and its brain-and-body-wearying chase
after the unnecessary, I’ve thought of the brook
that slips out from among a great mass of
Hard Fern in the birch and hazel coppice up
above, and wanders across the orchis field, with
ragged robins fluttering their tattered pink petals
beside the sterner browns and greens of flowering
reeds, and broad masses of marsh mint—that is
a mass of bluey-mauve in August—spreading in
big clumps and bosses wherever it can find a bit
of damp earth.</p>

<p>I’ve shut my eyes in the noisy City train,
and in a moment I’ve gathered a big bunch of
the quaking grass, brown, with a tinge of purple,
and the yellow stamens dangling from each little
tuft. And the comfort that the brook and the
orchises and the reeds and the under carpet of
tiny flowers have brought me, has been worth
more to me, personally, than the money that
twenty haystacks might have realised.</p>

<p>But to-day the field was just one white sheet,
like all the rest of the landscape. Along the
south side of the wall the snow was not so
heavy, and using the broom as an alpenstock,
I plodded up the field—giving a wide berth to
the place where the brook was down below—till
at last I reached the woods, first a coppice of
birch and hazel and oak, and adjoining it a
larch-wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Once under the trees, the going was “all
according”! It depended on whether the snow
was still on the branches, or had come down in
small avalanches to the ground beneath. But I
determined to struggle on. I was warmer than
I had been since the previous summer, and more
pleased with life than I had been since before
the War started. The larch-wood offered the
easier travelling, since there are not the down-drooping,
low-lying branches of sundries that are
always catching at one’s hat and hair in the
mixed woods. With the larches you know just
what to expect and where to find it. The
needles make a fairly soft carpet, brambles are
rare, and all you have to do is to gauge the level
of the lowest of the bare brown branches, and
pitch your head accordingly.</p>

<p>I looked at the wood before I ventured in.
Everything seemed as usual. The outside trees
that border the field are mixed firs, pines, and
Wellingtonia. These do not shed their leaves
as the larches do, and they stood up strong and
erect, save where the heaviest laden boughs were
bending under their weight of snow.</p>

<p>For the first few yards the trees were normal,
standing in orderly ranks, much like the aisles of
an old ruined cathedral, wherein the snow has
freedom of entry. Every twig, every cone, had
its glistening decoration. When a gust of wind
shook tree or branches, down came the snow, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
powder for the most part, for the under branches
broke the masses as they fell, and sent them
flying in all directions.</p>

<p>Suddenly I emerged from the sombre half
light of the wood, into brilliant sunshine, with
clear space above. Yet—I wasn’t through the
wood; what did it mean? And what were
these great white masses that blocked all further
progress? I had never seen this spot before,
though I know every tree in that wood; to me
they are like individual children.</p>

<p>Then I saw that what lay before me was a
piled-up mass of trees, torn bodily up by the
roots and lying in all directions one on top of each
other. For a moment something almost akin
to fear seized me, the awesomeness that comes
over one when in the presence of a force that is
utterly beyond one’s puny power to compass or
restrain. Here was a footprint, indeed, of the
storm that had done this stupendous thing.</p>

<p>The fringe of the wood all round was intact;
the blizzard seemingly having swirled down, a
veritable whirlwind, into the very centre of the
plantation, tearing the trees out of the ground,
and flinging them about in uncontrolled fury.</p>

<p>It was an impressive sight—even with the
kindly snow covering up the wounds and the
gashes, and doing its best to obliterate the harsh
look of devastation that lay over the scene.</p>

<p>Retracing my steps, I ran into another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
explorer who was likewise trying to dodge a
snow-bath round a tree trunk.</p>

<p>It was Virginia.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to interrupt your meditations,”
she said politely, “and I won’t detain you a
moment. I’ve merely come to ask if you would
mind lending me your rubbers—not your best
ones you have on, but the second best with the
seven holes in the soles and one heel gone—in
order that I may go to the neighbours and borrow
a slice of bread. ‘We ain’t like them as asks,’”
she went on, quoting a favourite expression
of a well-known whiner in the village, whose
practice is to take without asking, “‘but it do
seem hard when you see yer own flesh and blood
a-crying for vittels.’ Not that I would presume
to interfere with your household arrangements
and upset your meals, but what with Ursula in
a dead faint making her will, and Eileen packing
up to return to her grandmother in order to get
something to eat——”</p>

<p>“What’s the time?” I cut her short.</p>

<p>“It was two when last I saw the clock, but
I’ve wandered miles since then in search of you,
hence the fact that my own rubbers are worn
out.”</p>

<p>Then I remembered that I had never mentioned
the matter of meals to Eileen that
morning; though, in any case, there wasn’t much
that could be cooked till that sheep was killed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
come Friday: we had naught but the remains of
a shoulder of mutton.</p>

<p>“How did you find where I was?” I enquired,
as we ploughed our way back.</p>

<p>“Footprints, oh, blessed word!” she said.
“In any case, you shed your garments wherever
you went, and thoughtfully left your coat hanging
in the larch avenue; Eileen saw it in the
distance and came shrieking to us that the
burglar had evidently hung himself from a tree
by the top gate!”</p>

<p>As there proved to be nothing at all on the
mutton bone, we decided to reckon it a meatless
day, and we sat down to a lunch of bread and
cheese and coffee—each reading a cookery book
the while. The Food Authorities surely couldn’t
object to <i>that!</i>—and you’ve no idea what a
fillip it gives to a war-meal, if you’ve never
tried it.</p>

<p>Collecting cookery books, ancient and modern,
being one of my hobbies, there was a fine assortment
to choose from. I selected “Ten Minutes
with my Chafing Dish,” and what that author
did in the time you would never credit! My
bread and cheese became, in turn, braised terrapin,
crayfish omelette, creamed oysters with
Spanish onions, escalloped chicken with mushrooms,
and fricaseed trout with paprika sauce.</p>

<p>I had it all at the one meal, no questions
asked about the number of courses and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
ounces of flour, and it only cost me about sixpence
including the coffee.</p>

<p>Ursula, who had annexed a 1724 volume, ate
her frugalities to the accompaniment of Double
Rum Shrub; but, as I told her, I was thankful
I had been better brought up.</p>

<p>Virginia chose “The Scientific Adjustment
of Food Values”; and, before she had got
through the first chapter, started to blame me
for giving them cheese <i>and</i> butter, when I might
know that both contained a sweeping majority
of proteids. Whereas, what she found she really
needed was cheese and water-melon (though
cantaloupe might take its place), and why wasn’t
there water-melon (or cantaloupe) on the table?
She had known all her life long that she needed
it—always had an undefinable longing steal o’er
her about twelve o’clock midday and again at
four-thirty—but her want had never been made
articulate before, simply because she wasn’t sure
of the name of the missing link. Now, however,
if I expected to retain my hold on their
affections, she must really ask me to see that
water-melon——</p>

<p>But I was too deep in the enjoyment of a
dish of anchovy and caviare canapes at the
moment to interfere. I left her at it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the afternoon, as we were short of milk,
I suggested that we should go ourselves to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Jones’s farm in search of more. There was a
beaten track along the lanes now, so we took
the tin milk-can and started off uphill, thereby
just missing the Head of Affairs, who came
swinging up the road from the village. Having
seen the finally departing back of the very last
workman, he had caught the next train and
arrived unannounced.</p>

<p>The wind was keen when he got up out of
the valley, so he turned up his coat collar and
rammed his cap well on his head. Finding the
cottage door locked, he knocked briskly and
started to inquire for me, when Eileen (whom
he had never seen before, remember) opened
the door in response to his knock. But, to his
amazement, before he got a couple of words out,
the door was banged to, in his face, and he was
informed through the large keyhole—</p>

<p>“The lady is not—I mean—she <i>is</i> at home,
but she is engaged; she is—er—she is entertaining
friends and can’t see anyone.”</p>

<p>Exceedingly bewildered, the caller waited a
minute, trying in vain to catch sounds of hilarity
within, and then rapped again; and, as the keyhole
seemed the correct channel of communication,
he said through the aperture—</p>

<p>“Kindly tell your mistress that her husband
is here.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, then the voice within
said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“The lady is sorry she can’t see <i>anyone</i> to-day,
as she is ill in bed.”</p>

<p>The mystery thickened. Going round to
the back door, which was also locked, the caller
rapped more vigorously still. This time an
agitated voice wailed from the inside—</p>

<p>“Are you still there? Oh, <i>please</i> go away!”</p>

<p>But, though he was exceedingly astonished
at this curious reception, he had no intention of
going, and he said so. Eileen’s next question
was unexpected.</p>

<p>“What is your Christian name?” she began.
He told her. “What is the colour of your
hair?”</p>

<p>He proceeded to describe himself, and
added—</p>

<p>“If you have any doubt about me, let the
dog out, he’ll soon tell you if I’m a genuine case
or an impostor.”</p>

<p>The dog was whining inside, and trying frantically
to get out. The girl debated, and then
said—</p>

<p>“All right; but you won’t mind waiting a
minute?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all!” he replied, with sweet
sarcasm. “I don’t mind in the least how long
I stand here in the cold. I quite enjoy it.”</p>

<p>Then suddenly the door was flung open, and
Eileen, holding a photo of the Head of Affairs
in her hand, which she had fetched down from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
my bedroom, started to compare it carefully
with the original.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she sighed; “you are something
like it.”</p>

<p>But the visitor had walked in unceremoniously,
with the joyful dog leaping around.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said severely, as he took off his
coat. “Where is your mistress?”</p>

<p>Eileen looked mournful. “If you please,
sir, I’m <i>very</i> sorry, but I told you a <i>wicked</i>
story just now. The mistress isn’t entertaining
friends”—that was self-evident, as the cottage
living-rooms were empty, and it was hardly the
kind of day one would choose to entertain
friends in the garden—“and she isn’t ill in bed
neither. She isn’t here at all. But I didn’t like
to say so at first. I was afraid, not knowing
who you were, and coming after the shock.
Have you heard the awful news?”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed the harassed, hungry man,
jumping to his feet again in alarm. “What’s
happened?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you heard?” and Eileen lowered
her voice to an hysterical whisper. “<i>We’ve
discovered footprints!</i>”</p>

<p>By this time the Head of Affairs was quite
convinced in his mind that either the girl was
not in the full possession of her senses, or else she
had been to see a Robinson Crusoe pantomime,
and it had turned her brain, so he merely said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you’ll now try if you can
discover some coffee, and that as quickly as
possible.” And he dismissed her when he had
ascertained where we had gone, as he was rather
weary of the whole performance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile my guests and I were making a
few neighbourly calls in passing. In a scattered
community that is often cut off by the weather
from intercourse with its fellow-kind, a little
gossip is always welcome. Not idle gossip, I
would have you understand; but talk on things
of serious import. For instance, I was naturally
very glad to learn from one of my neighbours
that old Mrs. Blossom had not been secretly
harbouring a German spy after all, as it turned
out that the masculine under-vests that had been
hung out each week lately with the wash really
belonged to her late husband; and after cherishing
them for five years, she had decided it was
more patriotic to wear them herself at a time
like this, than to buy herself new ones when
wool was so badly needed for the troops.</p>

<p>It was a real satisfaction to get this mystery
cleared up at last, as her clothes-line each
Monday morning (when the weather was fine)
had worried us greatly. When I say “us” I
don’t mean myself necessarily, because I fear I
hadn’t kept track of her washing as I ought to
have done if I called myself a friend and neighbour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Most remiss of me, of course. Still,
there it was; and I had no need now to creep
along beside the hedge and take an inventory of
her garments; neither need I fear for the safety
of our hill.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with us time is of no importance,
the clock really doesn’t signify, even
if it goes, which isn’t guaranteed; we divide
the day into three meals, which are regulated
by the three trains that puff up the valley,
week-days only. Sunday is more of a problem,
if you have children to be got off to
Sunday-school; but as Mrs. Jasper has the one
reliable clock up in our corner of the hills, her
children set the pace; and when Maudie Jasper’s
starched China silk Sunday frock is seen to be
coming along the lane, accompanied by other
little Jaspers in Lord Fauntleroy blue velvet
suits and a bunch of everlasting pea, blush roses
and southernwood for teacher, then the two or
three other cottages in the vicinity hurry up and
add their quota to the little procession that
walks decorously (so long as it is in sight of
maternal eyes) down the hillside trail to the
Sunday-school in the valley.</p>

<p>Of course awkward mistakes sometimes
happen, as they do in the best of well-regulated
families. It was so on the occasion of the first
introduction of Daylight Saving. Naturally the
weekly newspaper and the vicar and the schoolmaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and everybody, had explained to everybody
else that on a certain Saturday night the
clock must be put forward one hour, etc. We
are anything but behind the times on our hills,
and no clocks in the whole of the British Isles
were set forward an hour more eagerly than ours
were; only, obviously, if you haven’t a clock
that goes, you can’t set it forward; therefore
our little corner looked feverishly in the direction
of the Jasper clock, and frequently reminded
the Jaspers of their national duty.</p>

<p>To make quite sure that the important rite
wasn’t overlooked, Mrs. Jasper put the hands of
the clock on an hour when first she got up on the
Saturday morning, instead of last thing at night,
as the authorities had decreed. An hour more
or less made no difference to the family, seeing
that it was Saturday and no school to be thought
of. Meals came as a matter of course, and quite
irrespective of clocks. Mrs. Jasper knew that if
she didn’t see to the thing no one else would.
So she got it off her mind nice and early.</p>

<p>Later in the day Mr. Jasper thought of the
new official regulations <i>re</i> Daylight Saving; and
knowing the uselessness of ever hoping to get a
brain that was merely feminine to grasp any
great truth as set forth in newspapers, he himself
put the clock on an hour; as master of the
house he regarded it as his peculiar office to see
that the law was duly enforced. He didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
mention the matter to his wife; what would be
the good? And it wasn’t her concern anyhow;
but as he shut the door of the clock, he wondered
where indeed the household would be if
it were not for him and his thoughtful habits!</p>

<p>Then there was Maudie Jasper. Being a
bright child of twelve, brought up on modern
educational lines, naturally she had no very high
opinion of her parents’ intellects. Since it was
she who illumined the home with the torch of
learning, she felt it devolved on her to see
that the clock kept abreast of current events.
Besides, she was a shining example in the matter
of Sunday-school tickets; she didn’t intend to
be late next morning. So she, too, put on the
hands an hour.</p>

<p>It was just as Mrs. Jasper was going upstairs
to bed at night, tired out with the Saturday night
bathing of the children, that the clock stared
her in the face, and the question arose: Had
she, or had she not, put on that clock an hour
as she had meant to? Her memory isn’t good
at the best of times, and she was especially done
up with a day that somehow had not seemed
<i>nearly</i> long enough for its accustomed duties,
though she couldn’t make out why. But to
make quite sure, she gave the hands a flick
round; better be quite certain than have Maudie
late for Sunday-school. Only she did wish they
didn’t leave <i>everything</i> for her to do!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning, when the Vicar drew up his
blind at 7 <small>A.M.</small>, as is his unfailing wont, he saw a
small group of children standing forlornly outside
the Sunday-school door, waiting for the
10 o’clock opening!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Jasper’s was the next cottage we called
at, to inquire after her husband, who was now at
the front. Mrs. Jasper was delighted to see us,
and of course asked if we had further news of
the burglar, the fame of our footprints having
spread far and wide. She told us all about the
neuralgia in her head, and seemed much relieved
when we assured her that it was not at
all likely to turn to appendicitis.</p>

<p>She had had a lurking fear that if it became
appendicitis, she would have to go to a hospital,
and she hadn’t much belief in hospitals. There
was her sister’s little boy Tommy, up in London,
just four years old, and all nerves, as you may
say; screamed and kicked like anything if you
didn’t give him what he wanted the moment he
asked for it. They couldn’t do nothing with
him.</p>

<p>At last they decided to take him to a hospital;
so her sister-in-law and “his” mother
went with her. And what do you think the
doctor said, after they’d told him the symptoms?
“Temper,” he says; “just bad temper. Take
him home, and spank him next time it comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
on.” And that was all they got!—cost them
fivepence each for car-fares too!</p>

<p>We asked after her own family. Maudie
was getting on splendidly at school, “really a
first-class scholard she is, although it’s I that say
it. Can read the Bible beautifully now—or at
any rate the Testament” (with a desire to be
absolutely truthful). “And when I’m writing
to her father, and can’t quite rec’lect how to
spell a word, she can tell me two or three
different ways of spelling it, right off pat!”</p>

<p>At the next cottage we stopped to inquire
after a man who had met with an accident,
which necessitated the amputation of one leg
below the knee. Having given him all our own
“Surgical Aid” letters, and fleeced our friends of
theirs, I naturally asked why he wasn’t wearing
the artificial limb that had been procured? (it
was reposing artistically on the top of the chest
of drawers in the kitchen, a stuffed sea-gull under
a glass shade on one side, balanced by a wedding-cake-top-ornament
under glass on the other).
Wasn’t it comfortable? I asked. Didn’t it fit?</p>

<p>“Oh, yes’m, thank you; it fits beautiful.
But that’s my <i>best</i> leg; and the missus likes me
to keep it there where she can show it to everyone,
and I only uses it for Sundays and Bank
’Ollerdis.”</p>

<p>Then we looked in on Mrs. Granger, a happy-go-lucky
widow who is always passing round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
hat. When we knocked at the kitchen door,
she was pouring down the sink the liquor in
which she had just boiled a piece of bacon. I
couldn’t help asking mildly and deferentially:
“Have you ever tried using the liquor of boiled
bacon for making pea-soup? It’s very nourishing,
as well as tasty.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger smiled at me indulgently.
“Well, ma’am, seeing that I’ve buried two
husbands and three children, no one, I fancy, can
give <i>me</i> points about feeding a family!”</p>

<p>At Mrs. Jones’s we made a longer call; we
simply had to, as we were wanting milk, and she
made no move to get it, but merely stood talking.
There was the mirror over the parlour mantelpiece,
she particularly wanted us to see that.
Arundel Jones (aged eleven) had smashed a hole
right through the glass when practising bomb-throwing
in there. But would you ever know it,
the way Patricia (aged seventeen) had decorated
it? And as we couldn’t think what to say, we
looked long and earnestly at the bunch of artificial
and rather faded roses from Patricia’s hat
that had been stuck in the hole, with some green
paint daubed around on the glass to represent
leaves. Fortunately, Mrs. Jones didn’t wait for
our opinion—took it for granted, indeed, since
there could only be one opinion about such
a masterpiece—and proceeded to ask what I
thought could be done with so artistic a girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>And that reminded her, could I tell her
where she could write to in London for some
Loop Canvas at a penny a yard? Patricia
wanted to make some slippers for a young man
friend of hers who was at the front, and sweetly
pretty too, with forget-me-nots all over; but it
said you must have penny Loop Canvas. She
had asked for it in Chepstow, but they had never
heard of it, the cheapest they had was 1<i>s.</i> 4¾<i>d.</i>,
and no loops in it at that. But, of course, you
could get everything in London.</p>

<p>I had never heard of the canvas myself (and
I thought I knew most that was going!), but in
any case, she wouldn’t get any canvas at 1<i>d.</i> a
yard now, I told her; she had evidently got hold
of some very old directions.</p>

<p>No, she hadn’t; it was in last week’s <i>Home
Snippets</i>, and she got the periodical out from
among an assortment of similar data under the
horse-hair sofa squab, to show me.</p>

<p>There, under the heading—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">A Dainty Cosy-Comfort for your Boy
in the Trenches</span>,”</p></div>

<p>it described how to make a pair of wool-work
slippers, commencing with “Get a yard of
Penelope canvas.”</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Jones was uneasy about her step-daughter,
Kathleen, who was in service near
Chepstow. “The food’s all right; but the lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
isn’t what I call a good wife—never thinks of
brushing her husband’s best clothes and putting
them away for him of a Monday morning, and
yet I’ve never once missed doing that since I
married Jones. And I assure you, when I
married him, he hadn’t a darned sock to his
back. I’m sorry Kathleen hasn’t a better example
before her, for she’s inclined to be flighty.
She’s got a week’s holiday next month, and
nothing will do but she must go and visit her
cousin, who is working at munitions in Cardiff.
I say to her, ‘Cardiff’s a nasty noisy place; why
don’t you go and visit your Aunt Lizzie at
Penglyn, she’s so worried she can hardly hold
her head up some days, and cries from morning
till night; and would be thankful to have someone
to talk things over with; or your father’s
Cousin Ann at Caerleon, they’ve had a sight of
trouble there, and never see a soul nor go out
of the house from week end to week end; they’d
love to have you.’ But no, it’s Cardiff she
wants,” and Mrs. Jones sighed at the unaccountable
taste of one-and-twenty!</p>

<p>“Ah, no one knows what an anxiety that girl’s
been to me,” went on the buxom, good-natured
woman, who in reality never makes a trouble of
anything, and has been a real mother to Kathleen.
“I sometimes wonder why I married her
father! But there, I will say it looks better on
your tombstone to have ‘The beloved wife of,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
rather than plain Martha Miggins (as I was), all
unbelongst to no one, as it were.”</p>

<p>Don’t imagine for a moment that this implied
matrimonial divergence on the part of Mr. and
Mrs. Jones, for a more contented couple you
couldn’t find in the village. It is merely the
polite way we have, locally, of discounting our
blessings, lest we should seem to be flaunting
our happiness in the face of less fortunate people.</p>

<p>“By the way,” she said, as we were going out
of the door, “have you heard who it was walked
around your place the other night? Well, now,
to think I should have forgotten to mention it,
but it was no one, after all, but the policeman!
My husband was over to the police-station this
morning about that mare we’ve lost, and he mentioned
it; and, sure enough, the policeman had got
it down in his book that he crossed the hill by our
road that night, and had looked over your house.”</p>

<p>And then I remembered that there was
a police-station in the next village, that did
duty for a very wide area of miles. And it was
usual for the policeman to patrol from one village
to another, by various routes, last thing at night,
ascertaining if the inhabitants’ doors <i>en route</i>
were all duly locked. We were much relieved
in our minds, and started for home discussing
the situation, when Virginia suddenly said—</p>

<p>“Surely that is our dog barking further along
the lane?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>We paused to listen.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” I said in surprise. “Whatever
can he be doing out here?” and we hurried on;
for the dog is a valuable one, and is never let out
without an escort. A turn in the lane brought us
face to face with a tall, familiar masculine figure.</p>

<p>“Why, wherever have you come from?” I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I’ve just made my escape from the tame
lunatic who seems to be in charge of the cottage,”
said the Head of Affairs cheerfully, as he relieved
Ursula of the quart of milk. “And I would
suggest, my dear, that the next time you propose
to turn your house into a sanatorium for
‘Mentally Deficients,’ you might give your
family due notice. A shock like that isn’t good
for one after climbing such a hill.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And he might not have been particularly
mollified when, later in the evening, Eileen
offered the following apology:—</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, sir, that I kept you waiting
outside all that time in the cold; only how was
I to know you were a gentleman, sir, when you
looked so <i>exactly</i> like a burglar?”</p>

<p>But, fortunately, in the interval he had discovered,
in his dressing-room, a new-but-forgotten
pair of boots, and a not-at-all-bad-considering-it’s-war-time
overcoat; and, naturally, he was
inclined to take a roseate view of life.</p>

<h2>XI<br />

<small>Exit Eileen</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was six months later, and about as broiling
a Sunday afternoon as London can produce.
Virginia and I were reading in the coolest spot
in the garden, when Abigail came out and
announced, with slight acidity, “That young
person wants to know if she can see you, madam.
I told her you were engaged, but she said she
would wait.”</p>

<p>“What is her name?” I queried; there are
so many young persons in the world.</p>

<p>“That Eileen!” she answered, this time
with a definite sniff.</p>

<p>“She can come out here,” I said, and forthwith
there sailed across the lawn a vision such as
never before had graced my garden.</p>

<p>Eileen was wearing a white Jap silk skirt; a
transparent rose pink blouse, that revealed the
satin ribbon and lace camisole beneath; pink
cotton open-work stockings; white shoes; one
of those long stoles made of metallic-looking,
lustre-brown fur, so beloved of the laundry girl;
a big white hat, trimmed with the most violent
of tangerine-coloured velvet, said velvet hanging
in festoons down the back, and loops of it caught
round the front and fastened to the fur stole—on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
one side with a large would-be-diamond lizard,
about four inches long, and on the other with
a crescent of similar make. Her hair, which
was done in a wild imitation of the latest eccentricity
of fashion, was radiant with more crescents
and a sparkling three-tiered back comb. A
string of large pearls adorned her neck.</p>

<p>To say I was taken aback at the sight, is to
put it mildly; I was fairly dumb with astonishment.
Where in the world had that demure,
mouse-like orphan been to pick up such ideas!
Even though I knew she had gone to work in a
munition factory, I wasn’t prepared for such
developments. She soon enlightened us.</p>

<p>After mutual polite inquiries about each
other’s health, and a few more relative to the
grandmother, she folded her hands in her lap,
sat as though posing for a photograph, and then
said: “And please, how do you think I look?”</p>

<p>“You are certainly very bright,” I stammered,
striving valiantly after truth.</p>

<p>“Yes, I look very nice, don’t I?” she went
on; “and I felt I ought to come round and
show you, because, as I tell everybody, it’s all
entirely due to <i>you</i>, ma’am, that I’m so stylish.
I shouldn’t never have <i>thought</i> to dress like this,
if you hadn’t taught me how. And now I’m
going round to show myself to Mrs. Griggles.”</p>

<h2>XII<br />

<small>The Old Wood-House</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> old wood-house stands on the lee-side of a
belt of trees, part of the Squirrels’ Highway, as
we call it, that runs down one side of the Flower-patch,
sheltering it from the bleak north winds.</p>

<p>Picture to yourself a building rather smaller
than a very small church, built of great blocks of
grey stone, with walls nearly two feet thick in
places, a red-tiled pointed roof, a door at one
end; and in case the walls should prove too
flimsy to stand the winter gales, huge stone
buttresses prop it up on the “off” side (i.e. the
side where the ground goes on running downhill),
lest the structure should take it into its
head to run down-hill too!</p>

<p>In place of a spire, above the door, a weathercock
swings its arrow to the winds—at least, it
would swing it on any well-conducted apex, but
being merely mine it permanently points south.
Not that it is particular where it points; all it
asks is to be left in peace to close its eyes in
meditative contemplation of the landscape. We
occasionally get a ladder and then a long stick,
and move it round, trying to urge it to deeds of
derring-do, but it falls asleep the moment our
ministrations cease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The last time, it was a neighbouring farmer
who climbed the ladder to reason with it, after I
had assured him there was no penalty under
the Defence of the Realm Act for regulating
weathercocks. He was a bit reluctant to touch
it at first; as he said, what with clocks not being
allowed to tick as they pleased, and the time
being jiggered with anyhow, you didn’t know
where you was with nothing. But once I had
taken full responsibility for the affair, he went
up with right goodwill, and—forgetting that it
was the arrow alone that needed to move—he
gave a sturdy tug to the north, south, east, and
west arrangement, and sent the arms of that in
all directions.</p>

<p>Then when we wanted to fix it up again, the
question arose, which was the north? A local
light supposed to know everything, who chanced
to be passing, was summoned for consultation.
After carefully surveying the various corners of
heaven, as though looking for enemy air-craft, he
said he didn’t know as he could say ezackly
which wur the north, unless he had summat to
tell him (we all felt like that, too!); but if we
would a-float a needle on the top of a basin of
water, then either the point of the needle—or—le’s
see? maybe ’twas the heye, he wasn’t quite
certain which—would point to the north, for
sure.</p>

<p>Well, all hands rushed for basins and needles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
as you may suppose; because, whether it was
the point or the eye didn’t matter much, since
we knew the direction in which the north lay;
all we wanted was the precise angle. But alas,
every needle promptly sank to the bottom of the
basin, without so much as a kick!</p>

<p>Eventually we refixed the north pole approximately,
pending such time as the Head of Affairs
should arrive, when I knew we could rely on the
small compass at the end of his watch chain.
But Virginia, who uses the weathercock more
than most of us, as she sees it from her bedroom
window, and says it is so useful to dress by, was
lugubriously certain his watch would be stolen
on the next journey down, and begged me to
place the arrow—still asleep—pointing south;
even an approximate south, she said, might at
least help to keep her spirits up, when a northeaster
was blowing.</p>

<p>And south it remaineth unto this day, despite
all our blandishments, and probably will do so
till the end of the War, when the retirement of
the Food Controller—who, presumably, supervises
weathercocks—may permit of our using a
modicum of grease.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The old wood-house (which, by the way, was
originally used for coals, though no trace of this
is left upon its clean, lime-washed interior) is the
first building you run across as you enter by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
top gate, which is the widest entrance we
possess. Here you step from the lane right into
a tiny larch plantation, and the path to the
cottage is arched over with the boughs of the
trees, while the brown cones crunch under your
boots, or roll away down the steep incline of the
path when your foot touches them. It was
among these trees that a small clearing was
made in the distant past to accommodate this
particular out-building; though why the coal-house
was considered the most artistic bit of
bric-à-brac to greet you as you enter the main
gate is not clear.</p>

<p>The actual outline of the building is not
remarkable, being merely four walls and a
pointed roof, with a door and a window; but at
least it looks simple, dignified, and solid, and
what it lacks in architectural decoration has been
supplied by Nature herself. When we first saw
it, we called it the private chapel; but later on
I found Abigail &amp; Co. calling it the picture
palace.</p>

<p>At any rate, there it stands, shadowed by
great oaks seemingly immovable, with their
gnarled wide-stretching arms spread as in blessing
over the lowlier woodland things; a big
Spanish chestnut, though tardy in coming into
leaf, scatters worthless burrs around later on,
with generous goodwill; a walnut-tree invites
the passer-by to rub its aromatic leaves, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
there any treasure-trove quite like the walnuts
that one finds in the long wet grass on a windy
autumn morning? Larches and firs make shady
colonnades, with their straight uprising shafts,
and dark drooping branches; silver birches,
always graceful, no matter how they may have
had to twist their trunks to accommodate themselves
to their environment, give lightness and
vivacity to the whole.</p>

<p>Incense there is in abundance. The warm
resinous odour of the larches is always abroad;
mountain-ash-trees load the air with scent in
the late spring, and are ablaze with crimson in
August. Two or three lichen-covered, twisted
old apple-trees hang out bunches of pale-green
mistletoe, for all to see during the winter months,
and then surprise one with a bride-like flush of
white and pink in the spring. Where the sun is
brightest, a big hawthorn carpets the ground
with white petals in May.</p>

<p>Then there are the lovely limes—and the
lime-tree is much more of a stately lady than is
realized by those who only know the sad,
maimed and distorted stumps that disfigure
suburban gardens in London. But see this lime-tree
that forms a link in the Squirrels’ Highway!
Its trunk measures about ten feet round. Under
the shadow of its drooping far-sweeping branches
you could give a small Sunday-school treat.
Though the lowest branches spring from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
trunk at least nine feet from the ground, their
far ends touch the grass, forming a complete
tent of translucent green and gold as you look
upwards, through a multitude of layers of leaves,
to a sun you cannot see, but which seems to
have turned the whole tree into a rippling mass
of molten colour. And when it shakes out its
bunches of scented yellow blossoms, and trails
them by the thousand down each branch and
stem, then indeed the lime-tree is a lovely lady,
and the bees and the butterflies come from far
and near to pay her homage.</p>

<p>And each tree has a special and distinct
winter-beauty of its own in the outline of
branches and stems and twigs—a beauty that is
lost to us once the leaves appear, but which
suggests an exquisite etching in winter when
the dark lines are silhouetted against the sky.
The most graceful is the birch, with its light
tracery of fine filaments, often with tassel-like
catkins dangling at the end. The oak and beech
give the impression of enormous strength in the
ease with which they fling outright their massive
arms with seldom any tendency to droop.</p>

<p>And each tree has its special and distinct
melody when the wind signals the forest
orchestra; there is the sea-surge of the beeches,
the swish of the heavily plumed firs, the rain-sound
of the twinkling aspen, the soft whisper
of the birches, the æolian hum of the pines, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the sibilant rustle of the dead leaves still clinging
to the winter oak.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Outside the wood-house door there is a little
clearing adjoining the grove of trees, where a
perfect thicket of wild flowers smiles at you for
the greater part of the year. First come the
early violets clustering about the roots of the
trees, and in the shelter of the grey rock fragments;
while primroses dot the grass with their
crinkly leaves, and then send up pink stems
covered with silver sheen, and delicately scented
flowers each as big as a penny. Oxlips grow on
the bank that borders one side of the clearing.</p>

<p>Later, it is an expanse of moon-daisies—thousands
of them swaying the whole day long
to the motion of the wind like the ever-restless
surface of the sea. And with the moon-daisies
are buttercups, crimson clover, rosy-purple knapweed,
spikes of pink orchis delicately pencilled
with mauve—all trying to grow to the height of
the big yellow-eyed daisies; while here and
there ruddy spears of sorrel out-top them all.</p>

<p>Tall grasses of every kind are here, some like
a fine translucent veil of purple, others grey, or a
pinky-green; some shaking out yellow or heliotrope
stamens; some ever trembling like the
quaking-grass—but all mingling with the tall
flowers, softening the surface of the mass of
white blossoms that seem in the sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
almost too dazzling to look upon, were it not
for the mist of the grasses that envelops
them.</p>

<p>Underneath the tall flowers there is a
wonderful carpet of lesser-growing things—masses
of trefoil, the yellow blossoms often
touched with fiery orange; patches of heath bed-straw,
with its myriads of tiny gleaming white
flowers, cling to any spot where the grasses leave
it room to breathe, its first cousin, the woodruff,
preferring a shadier part of the bank at the side—the
bank where the wild strawberries grow to
a luscious size, and whortleberry bushes add a
touch of wildness to the spot.</p>

<p>The smaller clovers, both yellow and white,
seem to thrive under the bigger flowers, where
most else would suffocate. Pink-tipped daisies
bloom wherever they can find room to hold up a
little face. Rosy-pink vetches wander about at
pleasure, and pretend they are going to do great
things when they start to climb the stems of the
moon-daisies.</p>

<p>Where the big fir trees throw a shadow, and
the sun only touches the grass when it is getting
round to the west, foxgloves send up shafts of
colour and the pale-blue spiked veronica carpets
the ground.</p>

<p>Still further back, where the sunshine never
penetrates, even here something strives to give
beauty to barrenness and soften austerity, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
small-leaved ivy starts to climb the hard tree
trunks, undoubtedly one of the most beautiful of
the many living things that are neighbour to the
old wood-house.</p>

<p>And always in the grass there lie the snapped-off
twigs and branches of the larches, with their
brown picots up stems that are studded with
exquisite cones. We strive hard to better
Nature, to make new designs, to evolve fresh
beauty; but with all our skill and experiments
we have yet to improve on the cone as a design,
with its rhythmic re-iteration of the one small
motif and the perfection of its proportions. In
my mind it ranks with the smoked-silver seed
ball of the dandelion, both of them examples of
absolute beauty derived from the simplest of
outlines.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The walls of the wood-house have their share
of green; on the north side an ivy, with a
gnarled main stem the size of a fair sized tree
trunk, sends evergreen branches over roof as
well as walls. Outside the door, which opens
to the south, stone-crop has planted itself in
masses among the stones, a perfect carpet of it,
that in June is a bright yellow. In the “good
old times,” before my day, the stone-crop served
as a convenient spot on which to dump the coal
sacks!</p>

<p>On the western side where the ground drops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
down—a warm, snug and sheltered bank—in the
long grass white violets bloom by the thousand
in the early spring, their sweet little blossoms
streaked with mauve, nestling up to the old grey
walls with the trustfulness of little children.
Add to this long-fronded ferns growing out from
among the wall stones, and you have an idea of
the geography of the place.</p>

<p>On a hot day the cool shade on the north
side is an ideal resting place; on a chilly day the
south side gives you a shield from the wind.
A pile of tree trunks and old logs lying outside
fairly ask you to sit for a moment and take in
some of the loveliness of the scene—you can
never exhaust the whole of it—and if you sit for
a minute you will probably sit there for hours.</p>

<p>Here is absolute quiet of spirit, but never
silence. The trees are seldom still; all day and
all night the wind upon these hills sways the tall,
lithe tops of the larches to and fro, to and fro;
the leaves and the catkins of the birches are for
ever fluttering; the vibrant branches of the pines
hum and sing in the breezes, summer or winter;
the music of it all never ceases though it varies
in volume according to the season. On the
hottest summer days the grasses still sigh; the
bees hum all day long in the clover; the blue-tits
tweet and twitter as they swing about the
birches, and their cousins the coal-tits keep up
an endless run of comment in the larches. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
May the nightingale comes into the grove to
sing; in June rival chaffinches perch on the top
spikes of certain spruce trees—always the same
bird on the same spike—and defy each other and
the world in general. The stock-dove croons
over its nest in the tallest firs, and the reddy-brown
squirrel scolds you severely if you are
coming too near his own particular chosen tree.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Inside the wood-house you may find many
things; some you are prepared for, some you
are not. In theory, it is sacred to the use of
the Head of Affairs, a sort of play-house and
workshop combined, wherein no handy man is
supposed to set foot, and no prying eyes are
supposed to discover that the owner is working
in a jersey, with no qualms over the absence of
waistcoat and stiff collar.</p>

<p>But I often go in when I am anxious to be
alone and wanting many things that one cannot
put down in words. And knowing this, the
Head of Affairs doesn’t keep his best saws
there!—not the splendid big “Farmer’s Saw,”
with its doubly notched teeth, that run through
big fir trunks with amazing ease; nor the finer
tools that deal with the short snappy branches.
No, the saw that is left for such emergencies is
a nondescript article that has now a wavy—very
wavy—edge, and a few of its teeth doubled over;
a saw that seems as though you can never get it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
well into the wood, and once you have got it in,
it can’t be got out again, much less be made to
move with soft purring motion.</p>

<p>You see, I have individuality where sawing
is concerned, but it is useless to talk about it, for
I’ve come to the conclusion that whatever other
moral improvements a woman may manage to
effect in the man she marries, it is a lifework to
get him to a proper appreciation of her method
of goffering a saw!</p>

<p>But I must beg you not to picture the wood-house
as the home of the miscellaneous collection
of nondescript oddments so indescribably dear to
every masculine heart. There is an outhouse
elsewhere that accommodates short lengths of
chain, pieces of wire netting, old locks, bits of
copper wire, staples and hooks, broken hinges
(that <i>might</i> be made do duty again, if any one
ever has a gate that prefers its hinges to be
broken), oil cans, a piece of lead pipe, various
lengths of iron rods, broom handles, stale putty,
old keys, a couple of invalided padlocks, and—well,
you know the type of things that every
self-respecting man likes to gather around him,
and keep handy, in case he might need them at
any moment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately one of the many blighting
influences of town-life, for ever hindering the
full flowering of one’s better nature, is the lack
of the necessary space to stock such useful items.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
But in the country one is not so hampered, and
one’s private marine store grows apace, and
differs only according to the temperament of the
collector. Indeed, I have come to the conclusion
that country air develops in man and
woman alike that tendency to hoard, which is so
noticeable in early childhood, when the small
girl collects buttons and clippings from her
mother’s sewing-room, and the small boy bulges
the blouse of his sailor suit with string and
“conquers” and coloured chalks, and old penknives
and young frogs.</p>

<p>In town a woman’s only outlet, as a rule, is
the bargain counter or annual sale or remnant
day. These dissipations are denied us in the
country, but we make up for it in many other
directions. My own particular weakness is jam-jars,
and the way I pounce on any round pot, be
it glass or earthenware, that looks as though it
might be made to hold jelly or jam, is quite a
study in efficiency. And, like all expert collectors,
my collection has sub-divisions, or perhaps
you would call them ramifications; cups that
have lost their handles, jugs ditto, glasses that
once held a rolled tongue, or fish paste, are all
included; and friends, as they bring round a
portmanteau full of empty jars at Christmas or
on my birthday, say, “It is so nice in your case
that one knows what you actually want; so
much better to give anyone what they really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
like, and will use, rather than some useless bit of
jewellery.” And I quite agree.</p>

<p>There was one moment when I feared my
jars would have to go in the general rending
asunder of domestic life caused by the War,
even though I had determined to stick to them
as long as I could. But when that “one clear
call” came for jam-pots, naturally I couldn’t be
a traitor to my country, and I decided the jars at
least must go, even though I might perhaps
retain the handleless cups and jugs. So I
told Abigail to let me know when the grocer
called.</p>

<p>I interviewed the young lady wearing high
white kid boots and an amethyst pendant on her
bare chest, who brought my next large consignment
of groceries, that had to be bought in order
to secure a little sugar. But when she heard
that there were jam-jars to go back, she looked
at me coldly from the doorstep, and hurriedly
pushing her basket further up her arm (lest I
should attempt to force them into it, I presume),
the Abyssinian gold bracelets clanking the while,
haughtily informed me that her motor was for
delivery only, not for the cartage of empties, and
suggested that I should write the manager and
see if he would consent to receive them.</p>

<p>I’m only human after all, and naturally any
woman’s temperature would rise in the face of
such spurning of her free-will offerings. I didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
write, and I’m using the jam-jars still. The
nation doesn’t seem any the worse off—though
Virginia points out to me that the War <i>might</i>
have ended sooner had I insisted on handing
them over; she says every little helps, as is
proved by the fact that the very week she put
her first 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> into Exchequer Bonds the
Government got the first “tank.”</p>

<p>At any rate, as I never eat preserves myself, I
can still, even with a restricted sugar allowance,
enjoy the peculiar pleasure that arises within a
woman’s soul when she is occasionally able to
say, quite casually as it were, to a friend:
“Would you care to have a pot of my new
gooseberry and cinnamon jam? They say it’s
rather good, though of course—etc.” And the
friend replies: “Oh, I should <i>love</i> it, dear; <i>such</i>
a treat; that jar of ginger marmalade I took
home last time was positively <i>delicious</i>. Everyone
said—etc.”</p>

<p>One favourite item for collection among the
cottagers is old bottles, and the stock you will
see in some of their outhouses is often most
extensive and varied. On one occasion an old
man who was doing some odd days’ work for me
about the garden, in the absence of the handyman,
was deploring the way the rabbits devastated
the cabbages.</p>

<p>“I’ll get rid on ’em for ’ee if you’ll leave
’em to me!” he assured me. I said I only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
wished he would, as they are a real plague at
times.</p>

<p>Imagine my horror a few days later when I
took some friends along to see the vegetables, to
discover a legion of empty whisky bottles,
labels intact, neck downwards in the soil, and
dotted about the vegetable garden in all directions.
The old man explained that they were
put there to skeer they rabbits, as they was
dreadful frit of bottles! But my friends refused
to believe that so honest-looking an old Amos
could have brought them with him!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The inside of the wood-house is as aloof as
are the hills from our machinery-driven, smoke-begrimed,
petrol-flavoured twentieth century.
Even when work is in progress, here is no
hustle; there are no short cuts to the other side
of a larch log; the saw must go steadily,
patiently, almost slowly, if it hopes to get
through the tree at one standing.</p>

<p>To step from the hot noonday glare, on a
summer day, into the cool seclusion of these
thick stone walls, is to enter a haven of peace
and quiet that would seem to belong to the
forest primeval rather than to this noise-stricken
age.</p>

<p>The window opening to the north excludes
the fierce sun, but the yellow-washed walls give
light and cheeriness. And the ivy, that ubiquitous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
plant that scorns all disadvantages, and
overcomes every obstacle, has crept in under
the red tiles and hangs in festoons from the dark
rafters; while in other places its pale green
shoots have found for themselves a way clean
through the thickness of the wall, pushing along
crevices and around the stones, till at last they
have come to light on the inner side, where they
immediately proceed to drape lopped trunks and
big branches standing in the corner.</p>

<p>It is no mere accumulation of timber and
sticks that is housed within these rough old
walls. The very spirit of the forest seems to
permeate the place; everything is part and
parcel of the big outside—the stones that pave
the floor; the heap of cones in one corner,
waiting to brighten up smouldering winter fires
and set them all aglow; the solid sections of
some sturdy oak, cut to just the right height
for seats; the bark stripped from a birch-tree,
silver white even now, with grey and pinkish
paper-like peelings and black breathing marks;
and the great brown branches of larch, a tracery
of studded twigs and stems and cones, that have
been placed across the end of the wood-house,
and sweep the rafters at the top, looking, as you
enter the door, like some wonderful rood-screen,
dark brown with age, shutting off an ancient,
yellow-washed chancel—though such a screen
no mortal hand could ever carve!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The larch is always in evidence, and gives a
resinous odour to the place, as does the sawdust
by the bench, a rich brown pile, for very little of
our hillside wood is white; most of it ranges
from reddish-brown to mahogany colour.
Though here is a small creamy-white gate in
course of construction—merely a little wicket
to keep the calves out of the orchard—that is
made of straight, round branches, slit down the
centre, so that one side of each is flat and the
other semicircular. The design is simplicity
itself, some uprights with a few cross-pieces to
hold them together and suggest a trellis; yet
the rich cream colour and the satiny surface of
the wood make it a thing of distinct beauty.
This is only a branch of the lime-tree, with the
bark peeled off.</p>

<p>In an ordinary way we seldom have a chance
to notice the intrinsic beauty of wood itself. Of
course we see it in its polished perfection when
it comes to us in some choice piece of furniture,
or panelling; but this is not exactly the beauty
to which I refer. Each branch, each tree trunk,
has, in its unpolished state, definite characteristics
of its own, quite distinct from those we see
in the finished product civilization regards as the
one end to be aimed for. These characteristics
may be rough, and are frequently rugged; but
their appeal is often all the stronger for this
fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Look at the wonderful ribbing on the rind of
this Spanish chestnut; what is it that wakes up
in you when you study its lines and formation?
You cannot say, yet you respond to it in an
indefinable manner. These branches of apple-wood,
only gnarled old things, twisted and
crooked and all out of shape some people would
say; yet you know that they would not have
been nearly so lovely had they been straight as
a dart. The larches with their strong bark
showing grey and red and green, and furrowed
like the sea sand—isn’t there something in this
that calls to you from back recesses of your
being, and reminds you of the time when you—no,
not you, but your ancestors, centuries ago,
lived not so much in cities and houses made
with hands, as out of doors, finding mystery in
the green-roofed aisles and the cathedral dimness
of forests long since felled?</p>

<p>To those of us who spend much time among
these hills, each tree within the wood-house
comes as a friend, with a definite personality and
distinct association, and we regret its individual
“going out,” even though we know it to be
inevitable.</p>

<p>This giant, that leans against the outside
wall, with no possibility of ever getting inside
the door until it has been sawn in half, is a big
fir (where a squirrel nested) that heeled right
over in a blizzard. Here is the tall cherry-tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
that died of a hollow heart, so beloved of the
birds that they left us never a one if we got up
later than half-past four the morning the
cherries were ripe. This is the bough from the
big plum-tree that broke down last August
under its weight of fruit. These branches of
old apple-trees are some of the winter wreckage
that was strewn about the orchards; see the
lichen that covers them, could anything be
more satisfying to look upon? And these are
some of the birches that seemed so frail as they
bent to the wind on the slopes, with purple
twigs and green leaves always moving; until
you have actually handled them you scarcely
realize the strength and toughness of the delicate-looking
bark, and you henceforth take a much
more personal interest in Hiawatha and his
canoe, even though his tree was another member
of the family. And that convenient stump you
are sitting upon is part of a hoary pear, that
used annually to clothe itself in white—and then
contribute more gallons of perry than it does to
think of in these more sober days!</p>

<p>But no mere catalogue of contents can
describe the charm of this little wind-swept
place. To realise it you must first of all stand
in need of quiet and retreat. When the craving
comes upon you that impels us all, at one time
or another, to get away from “things” and be
alone with ourselves and Nature that we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
re-discover our souls, take a book if you will
(it matters not what, for you won’t read it, but
to some it is essential that a book be in the hand
if they are to sit still for a moment!) and climb
the hill to that wood-house.</p>

<p>Take a seat on the beech log by the door,
and let yourself absorb some of the spirit of your
environment. Keep quite still when the squirrel
trails his bushy tail down the path, he won’t
inquire after your National Registration card;
neither will the pheasant, even though he raises
his head with a suspicious jerk as he is feeding
among the grass. Little rabbits will dart in and
out of their burrows among the bracken; the
woodpecker will mock at you from a tree that
waves above the roof; a robin will streak down
from nowhere, like a flash, and stand as erect as
a drill-sergeant on the corner of the work-bench
while he inquires—but, there is an interruption;
he excuses himself for a moment while he goes
off to thrash his wife who ventured to peep in at
the window. Let them all have their way, they
are as much a part of the general atmosphere
of the place as the sweet scent of the evening
dew upon the grass, and the ceaseless soughing
of the wind in the branches; moreover, this is
home to them.</p>

<p>The little folk of the forests are so companionable
when you know them; even the same
butterflies will come again and again. I recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
spent two hours a day for a fortnight in this
spot, and all the time apparently the same
butterfly hovered about the door, resting every
few minutes on the warm rock among the stone-crop
and fiercely chasing off any other butterfly
that came within its evidently marked-out
domain. And the little folk never bore you
with their boastings, nor weary you with platitudes.
They are content to let you think your
own thoughts, to take you as you are, if you
will but recollect that theirs are ancient privileges
that have descended to them as a world-old
heritage. It is you who, helpless in the grip
of civilisation, sold your forest “hearth-rights”
long since, and are now but a stranger, or at
best a passing guest, in this out-door world that
was man’s first home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gradually quiet possesses you, and you hear
the trees talking of things that have far outstripped
the clash and turmoil of modernity. What is
it they say, those swaying boughs and branches
that throb with every wind, and these that stand
around you, silently, waiting their last service
to man, each with some final sacrificial offering—the
apple-wood giving in incense, the oak giving
in strength, and the laurel giving in flame?</p>

<p>Theirs is a blessing rather than a message;
a lifting of a load from the over-burdened heart
rather than the teaching of stern lessons. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
as you shake off some of the dust of earth that
has clogged your soul, you find yourself sending
out thoughts in directions long forgotten; the
things of earth take on new proportions, the
first being often last, and the last becoming first.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ministry of the forest trees can never
be entirely explained; but one remembers with
reverence that our Lord Himself worked in
some such little wood-house, where He touched
the trees and fashioned the timber with His
sacred Hands.</p>

<p>Haply He left His Benediction when He
passed that way.</p>

<h2>XIII<br />

<small>Abigail’s “Lonely
Sailor”</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I’m</span> sure I didn’t start my career of usefulness
with any intention of adopting a “lonely sailor.”
It was Abigail who bestowed him upon me.</p>

<p>So far as I remember, it was something like
this.</p>

<p>Abigail had joined “The Domestic Helpers’
Branch” of a Guild, organised by some well-meaning
souls, for the purpose of befriending
those men in the Army and Navy who are
supposed to be without feminine kith or kin
of any description to take an interest in them.</p>

<p>She had been lured to a Guild meeting by
her friend Pamela.</p>

<p>Pamela, it should be explained, was my
parlour-maid, originally, but when the national
trumpet sounded for the reduction of one’s staff
of employees, she had moved a little further
along the road, to “The Gables,” a household
that fancied they needed a parlour-maid worse
than I did.</p>

<p>We were mutually quite satisfied with the
transference; she had recently had a sister enter
the service of a ducal family, and I had found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the effort necessary to keep pace with the
duchess exceedingly wearing. Kind hearts may
be more than coronets, but they don’t always
show to such advantage, since one has to wear
them inside.</p>

<p>As we had parted with no recriminations on
either side, naturally I begged Pamela to make
my house “a home away from home” whenever
she pleased, which she accordingly did; and it
was on one of her many “runs in” that she had
expatiated on the Guild in question, and induced
Abigail to sample it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And thus, Abigail had returned from the
meeting moved to the very core of her kind
heart by the harrowing details the speaker had
related of fine, daring, courageous, and magnificent
specimens of British and Colonial manhood,
left desolate and uncared for, pining for a word
of sympathy and understanding from someone
in the home-land—a word that never came, alas!</p>

<p>Abigail said it had quite put her off her
supper that night, thinking of all those brave
men, defending us and our homes right up to
their very last breath—and yet, never a woman
to get them a clean pair of socks or a hot meal
when all was over; not a letter of sympathy,
nor a card with a line on it (here cook told her
that funeral cards had quite gone out), not so
much as a word of encouragement from any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
relative under the sun, every woman at home
selfishly engaged with her own concerns—— Why,
it was a disgrace to the country that our
heroes should be neglected and put upon by the
women of the land in any such way! And
please would I mind her sending off a cake as
soon as possible? as of course she had adopted a
lonely sailor, wouldn’t have it on her conscience
not to; and cook was quite willing to make it,
there was plenty of dripping, and we still had a
fair amount of carraway seeds left, and they
wouldn’t come as expensive as currants—cook’s
cousins at the Crystal Palace liked carraways
<i>quite</i> as well as currants if plenty of spice and
peel was put in. The fried potatoes had nearly
<i>choked</i> her, when she was telling cook about it
all &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no, not because she was talking with her
mouth full; she meant that the very thought of
those poor lonely men was like eating sawdust.
The speaker at the meeting had said he was sure
each one present had only to ask her employer,
and permission would be given immediately and
gladly for a cake or potted meat or some other
little delicacy to be sent once a week, as a sign
of sympathy and understanding, to one of these
grand yet lonely souls.</p>

<p>Of course I immediately and gladly gave
permission for the concrete sympathy to be sent
once a week, but stipulated that it was to be a
cake; five shillings’ worth of meat, as per my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
butcher’s charges, goes positively nowhere when
“potted.” I reckoned that a good dripping
cake would give the desolate one a deal more
sympathy for the money.</p>

<p>(At the same time, to keep our rations
properly balanced I cut off the small plate of
spice buns, our only cake luxury, which had been
in the habit of adorning our Sunday afternoon
tea-table.)</p>

<p>And oh! the care with which we sewed up
that first box of sympathy in a remnant of cretonne,
carefully putting it on wrong side out (to
preserve its beauty), and hoping that when he
undid it he would notice what a charming pattern
of purple dahlias and blue roses was on the
inside, and how the cretonne was just a nice size
to make up into a boot bag if he chanced to be
needing a new one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I pass over the next few weeks while we
waited anxiously for the “lonely sailor” to
materialise. He was engaged on board H.M.S.
“The North Sea,” and sailors, we know, are
subject to wind and weather. Abigail said she
almost wished now that she had selected a lonely
soldier; she could have had one if she had liked;
but she had chosen a sailor because she thought
he might wear better. The German sailors didn’t
seem so pigheadedly bent on fighting as the
German soldiers were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>We did our best to keep the time from
hanging idly on our hands by devising as much
variety as possible for future menus, discussing
the respective merits of cinnamon <i>versus</i> cocoanut
as a flavouring, and wondering whether after all we
shouldn’t be more likely to buck up his desolate
spirits (and more particularly his pen) if we sent
a sultana cake next week, rather than gingerbread.</p>

<p>I never before knew Abigail so prompt in
her attendance upon the postman’s knock as she
was during those blank weeks that accompanied
the first half-dozen cakes. And then, when she
was in a very slough of dark despondency, and
constantly wondering who <i>had</i> eaten them, since
they had evidently never reached <i>him</i>, a letter
arrived, and forthwith Abigail trod upon air—figuratively,
I mean, not literally; in reality I
never heard her so noisy; she went up and down,
up and down the stairs past my study door where
I was working, as though she had lost a step
and was looking for it! Finally, when I heard her
singing “Days and moments quickly flying” as
she O-cedar-mopped some neighbouring polished
boards, I knew something must have happened,
and I opened the door and asked if anything
was the matter? Whereupon she produced the
letter from the bib of her apron—would have
brought it before, only knew I liked everything
to be perfectly quiet when I was working—and
didn’t I think it was a lovely letter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the handwriting wasn’t much to
boast of, and the spelling even worse, it was a
straightforward, man-like letter; he was evidently
very pleased to have the cakes, and quite
touched that the young lady should have been
so kind as to think of him. He said his people
were too far off to send him anything like that:
his father and mother had gone out to Canada
when he was ten years old. No one had sent
him a <i>parcel</i> so far, therefore it was quite a
surprise packet when the first one came. It was
kind of her to ask if he would like some more;
all he could say was—“the more the merrier,”
if the young lady felt like it.</p>

<p>And he signed himself, her faithful friend,
Dick.</p>

<p>After that Dick’s name became so all-insistent
in our midst that the whole household appeared
to exist solely for the purpose of revolving round
him. So constantly was it wafted on the four
winds of heaven, that I remarked to the Head
of Affairs: it seemed for all the world as though
we had adopted a pet canary, and were everlastingly
wondering if his seed glass had been
replenished.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was only one slight shadow falling
athwart the sunshine. Pamela (who was a
great authority on “How to tell your character
by your handwriting,” having had her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
delineated by her favourite penny weekly) had
declared that Dick was anæmic and delicate;
she knew, because his handwriting sloped downwards—a
sure sign; it was also cramped and
irregular, an unfailing indication of a mean and
grasping nature; while the heavy downstrokes
and the absence of punctuation proved as plain
as plain could be that he was unreliable.</p>

<p>Poor Pamela had had her own disappointments
in life, and had been warped a little
thereby.</p>

<p>Of course Abigail said she did not believe a
word of such rubbish, and she rather liked the
funny-shaped letters, and thought the black
strokes looked particularly strong and healthy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was surprising how that
trifle of seed, carelessly dropped, took root in
our minds, and how from that date onwards
we all regarded Dick as anæmic and in need of
strenuous nourishment; while if more than a
month elapsed between his communications, we
couldn’t help just wondering whether, after all,
he might not be a <i>little</i> mean and grasping, and
six weeks demonstrated with absolute certainty
that he was unreliable!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A month after we received his first letter,
there came another, and of course we all fluttered
with excitement.</p>

<p>Dick still approved of the cakes, I was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to hear; and since the young lady had asked if
there was anything else she could send, he wasn’t
one to cadge for himself, but there was his mate
Mick; he wanted to put in a word for him.
Mick, it appeared, was even more lonely, more
ignored by the world of women, more in need of
sympathetic understanding than he was; and—what
was more to the point—was badly in want
of a large scarf. Not that Mick would have
asked for it himself, very independent Mick was;
but since he had so enjoyed half of every cake,
and the nights were very cold this time of the
year, and he had been his pal for years, why, he
felt sure the young lady wouldn’t mind his just
mentioning it, as he couldn’t think of telling
her how short he was of socks himself.</p>

<p><i>Mind!</i> Why, we all regarded Dick as a
public benefactor! Abigail discovered that Dick
and Mick rhymed, and as she said, you didn’t
have poetry like that brought to the door <i>every</i>
day! She suddenly developed the airs of a
society belle; she borrowed my copy of “The
Modern Knitting Book;” and, might she just
run out for an hour in the afternoon to get some
wool—you needed thicker wool for scarves than
for socks—as the shops were so dark at night?</p>

<p>Cook, with her numerous cousins on H.M.S.
“Crystal Palace” (a near neighbour of ours),
was given to understand that she could now
take a second place! There was no getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
away from the fact that Mr. Dick and Mr. Mick
were actually engaged in the defence of the
realm, while cook’s cousins appeared to do
nothing more than take joy-rides in motor-lorries
to and fro along our road.</p>

<p>Pamela alone was sceptical; she said she
should go cautiously, you never knew! But
then, she had every reason to be a pessimist;
even her “lonely soldier” had been sent out to
China, and, naturally, you can’t sympathise so
understandingly with anyone when it takes a
couple of months before you get an answer to
your letter (if even he should chance to write by
return), as when he is only across the Straits of
Dover. She said she got tired of keeping copies
of her letters, so that she might know what he
was talking about when he wrote back—only he
never did!</p>

<p>Surmising that Abigail would have her
hand over-full if she took on the wants of both
men, I said to her, “I think <i>I</i> had better adopt
Mr. Mick, as I am sure you will have enough
to do to provide et-ceteras for Mr. Dick! You
can take all the credit for it, and write the
letters, but I will settle the bills.”</p>

<p>And having some socks and a large muffler
all ready for dispatch to some needy man, I
gave them to her and said I would pay the
postage, if she would save me the trouble of
doing them up and taking them to the post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
office. I also added that a cake had better be
sent once a week to Mr. Mick in addition to the
one sent to Mr. Dick. I know something of
the appetite of the Navy—and what is one
simple cake between two hearty men!</p>

<p>Abigail was effusively grateful, took it quite
as a personal favour; you might have thought I
was settling an annuity on her own father! She
explained that naturally she felt more interest in
Dick, and was more anxious to spend her money
on him; at the same time, she should certainly
mention my name to Mr. Mick; it wouldn’t be
fair to take all the credit to herself.</p>

<p>So we left it at that.</p>

<p>I consulted with cook on the subject of
securing ample and pleasing variety, combined
with unquestionable nourishment; and judging
by the amount of information she was able to give
me as to what “they” like, you would have thought
she had reared a whole family of husbands!</p>

<p>Forthwith, the house was steeped in a perpetual
aroma of baking cakes (of course the
cousins couldn’t be neglected either), till I got
nervous lest the Food Controller should make it
his business to call. Upstairs we not only went
cakeless, but in order to make sugar-ends meet,
we drank unsweetened tea and coffee, a trial to
all of us! And stewed fruit requiring sugar was
also taboo.</p>

<p>On second consideration, I am inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
think that it was not, first and foremost, my
benevolence that led me to adopt Mick: it was
primarily a matter of self-interest! Even in war
time it is necessary to have a <i>little</i> work done, if
only occasionally, in the home; and if the household
helpers were to take on yet another outside
responsibility, in addition to the many already
on their hands, I didn’t see where my work
would come in at all—and I can’t do <i>everything</i>
in the evening, after I get home from town.
As it was, we were already knitting morning,
noon, and night, for every branch of the Services!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I put the collection of figures and capital
letters that represented Mick’s address, into my
pocket-book with other similar data. Periodically
I handed Abigail pairs of socks or mittens, a
body-belt, handkerchiefs, and similar utilities;
and when any sea-going event, such as a raid on
a submarine base, or a “scrap” in the North
Sea, or a warship mined, brought the Navy
specially to my mind, I would go into the Stores
and order a parcel to be sent to Mick, adding
one for Dick also, if the occasion happened to
be a harrowing one. At such times one feels
one cannot do enough for our men; and Dick
and Mick little knew how often they benefited
by the misfortunes of others.</p>

<p>The first time I received a letter from my
devoted friend Michael McBlaggan, I admit I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
was a trifle bewildered, as I couldn’t for the
moment “place” any member of the McBlaggan
family; but when I read the document through
and noted how kind he considered it that my
friend Miss Abigail should have introduced us,
light dawned, and I sent him a post-card saying
I hoped he would always let me know if he
wanted anything further in the way of woollens.</p>

<p>And thus the months wore on, punctuated
by laboriously written communications from
Dick, with an occasional card from Mick, who
kept more in the background. The great attraction,
undoubtedly, was Dick. He entered into
personal details, asked if the young lady had
made the cakes herself. Here I understand cook
was not too absorbed in her own relations to
insist that full credit should be given to the right
person; and Abigail wrote explaining that as
she was very much occupied, and too busy to
attend to the cooking, a friend who lived with
her always made the cakes. Whereupon by
return post <i>I</i> received a sloping, heavy-downstroked
letter of thanks from the dutiful Dick!</p>

<p>On another occasion, Dick sent his photo
(after being asked for it times out of number, I
believe). It was not as satisfactory as it might
have been, because it was an amateur snapshot
group, and you know how easy it is to decipher
the features when the hand camera has stood a
quarter of a mile away (so as to include as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of the landscape as possible), and everyone’s
face is in black shadow under a hat brim that
has been tilted forward to exclude the full glare
of the sun.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he omitted to put a <b>X</b> against
himself, and as there were a dozen men in the
group all in slouch hats and farm attire (to say
nothing of the women and children), there was
little to help us!</p>

<p>But he did say that, as Abigail had told him
Canada was the one place above all others that
she longed to see, and how she was hoping to
go there as soon as the war was over, he had
sent his picture taken on a Canadian farm. It
was just a little gathering photographed on
someone’s birthday.</p>

<p>Still, as he hadn’t given us any help in the
matter, we had to decide ourselves which was
the lonely sailor (though, as Abigail commented,
she couldn’t understand how, with such a large
collection of friends, he could ever have come
to be so alone in the world). We picked out
a thin, anæmic-looking young man, who was
standing beside a comfortable, matronly woman
in a shady hat and a big apron; and as her age
might have been anything from thirty to sixty,
we decided she was his mother, and I remarked
what a nice homely soul she looked in her
checked apron, and no wonder he was devoted
to her, and how proud she must be of the dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
lad—all of which Abigail accepted as a personal
compliment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Winter gave way to spring, and in like
rotation mince pies were superseded by Swiss
roll (to make which eggs were struck off our
breakfast menu), and marmalade replaced the figs
and dates in the parcels that went out to some
unknown spot on the world’s ocean-spaces, all of
which our wonderful Navy now controls.</p>

<p>Likewise, cretonne gave place to unbleached
calico, my remnants being exhausted.</p>

<p>Existence downstairs fluctuated between
heights of excitement and depths of gloom. The
Crystal Palace authorities had a most unreasonable
way of shipping men off to Mesopotamia,
Salonika, Hongkong, Archangel, or anywhere
else where they thought the air would prove
salubrious, without a single word of inquiry as to
whether the transfer met with cook’s approval.
Hence, there was a series of constantly recurring
blanks to mar what would otherwise have been
a life of unsullied joyousness; and at such times
of depression cook darkly hinted that punching
tram tickets and ordering people to “move up a
little on that side, please,” would be a deliriously
exhilarating occupation compared with the
monotony of cake-making for nobody-knows-who!</p>

<p>As every gift-giver is aware, there is invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
a grey hiatus between the sending off of
the gift and the arrival of the recipient’s gratitude;
hence, the bustle and excitement of getting
off each parcel of eatables and pair of socks and
tin of tobacco was always followed by a spell
of wistful longing, while the postal authorities,
out of sheer perversity (we presumed), held back
the letter that would have meant so much to
Abigail.</p>

<p>Moreover, Pamela was doing anything but
contribute to the gaiety of nations! She was
often in with Abigail on her spare evenings;
and seemed to devote the time to perpetual
croaks, on one occasion ending with the assurance
that, for <i>her</i> part, she should have nothing
to do with a man who was merely a common
sailor; self-respect, if nothing else, would make
her look for something better than that.</p>

<p>I am glad to say Abigail had sufficient spirit
left to retort that if he was good enough to
fight for her, he was good enough for the
bestowal of a cake. Nevertheless, a decided coolness
sprang up between them; and for a week
or two after this exchange of confidences,
Abigail appeared to be sinking in a rapid
“decline” (as they used to call it), and I felt
I was positively inhuman to expect her to do a
hand’s turn in the house.</p>

<p>Yet life was not entirely bereft of purple
patches. The gloom consequent upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Silence of the Navy lifted occasionally. As, for
instance, when we had a bomb drop in our road.
Yes, in our very road!—or, at any rate, it was
only just round the corner; and, as everybody
knows, one affectionately appropriates as one’s
own all neighbouring roads (quite irrespective of
the rentals, too) if they chance to possess a
bomb. And, in any case, it <i>would</i> have dropped
in our road if only it had been a hundred yards
nearer this way.</p>

<p>Ours was quite an up-to-date bomb, one of
the sort that “went clean through the wood
pavement to the depth of a couple of feet, and
made a hole large enough to bury a man in, and
not a sound window within a mile radius.”
That’s the kind of bomb <i>ours</i> was! And it was
trimmed in the latest fashion, with a policeman,
and a cord right round it, and two gentlemen
with pickaxes who scratched the surface of the
wood blocks occasionally in the intervals of
looking important. They were wearing them
like that in London at the time.</p>

<p>Of course we, in common with the whole
parish, swelled with pride; for a while all social
distinction was waived, rich and poor alike took
the same interest in the bomb, or at least in the
hole it had made; the bomb itself was removed
so quickly that no local eye save that of the
police and the pickaxe gentlemen ever saw it;
though the milkman averred that, as he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
driving to the station in the early dawn, he saw
a van going in the opposite direction; he
couldn’t see what was in it, hence it certainly
was carrying away the bomb.</p>

<p>For the rest of us, however, we had to be
content with a brave effort to get as near to the
cord as we could, and crane our heads above our
shorter brethren in order to catch a glimpse of
the gaping void, while a thrill went down every
spine, irrespective of bank balances.</p>

<p>And we might have remained in that splendidly
democratic frame of back unto this day
(no one being anxious to have any closer acquaintance
than his neighbour with the bomb),
had it not been that a piece of shrapnel was
discovered in the garden next us. Whereupon
the owner developed much upliftedness, and his
servants bragged amain.</p>

<p>My own staff took it even more to heart
than I did; and it was amazing how much time
it was necessary for all hands to spend in the
garden in order to cut a cabbage or gather three
sprigs of parsley. Between them they didn’t
leave an inch of the garden unexplored, and it is
a fair-sized one.</p>

<p>Then the following morning Abigail rushed
in excitedly with the news that she had discovered
a piece of shrapnel in the bonfire débris.
I went down to inspect, and was shown an
oblong piece of curved iron, wider at one end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
than the other, and with a sharp spike at the
wider end. I confess that to me it was wonderfully
reminiscent of the old trowel that had lost
its wooden handle and had lain unhonoured and
unsung for a year in the leaf-heap; but I said
nothing about <i>that</i>. Whatever its origin, it was
crumpled up a bit with heat, one could see—not
surprising either, as we had had a roaring
bonfire two days running and burnt up all the
pile of dead leaves.</p>

<p>When I was devising plans for its removal,
they said, Hadn’t it better wait there till the
master came home?</p>

<p>But the Head of Affairs is celebrated for his
truthfulness; and he and that old trowel had
lived on terms of unalloyed friendship for years
(till the split came over the handle), and—well,
I merely said I thought we would deal with it
at once; no need to add to the master’s many
worries.</p>

<p>Cook said: Oughtn’t it to be immersed in
a pail of water? Her cousin at the Crystal
Palace had told her that——, etc.</p>

<p>So we got a pail of water; I bade them
stand well out of harm’s way, while I put it in.
Of course they feebly offered to do it for me,
but seemed relieved when I insisted on taking
all risks; one ran to one side of the garden and
one to the other, and then decided they should
feel safer if they both stood close together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as I was about to pick it up, cook
shrieked out to me not to touch it with my
hands, as it might be poisoned. I said I would
take it up with a pair of tongs; but she said she
thought it ought to be insulated with china. It
might be electrified with the shock; you never
knew what inventions those fiends were up to,
and one of her cousins who was in the electricians’
corp (or something like that) had told her
that——, etc.</p>

<p>So we compromised with a large china soup
ladle and a big wooden spoon, which I used like
chop sticks, and at last got the shrapnel into the
water. Of course it was disappointing when it
dropped heavily to the bottom without so much
as a sizzle, much less a bang. Still—we had the
comfortable feeling that we were on the safe
side now.</p>

<p>Eventually I had it in my study. I said it
would be safer there. But though the neighbourhood
was thus debarred from seeing and
handling it, the fame of it spread with amazing
rapidity; and the lady across the road arrived
quite early in the afternoon, having heard from
her housemaid, who had heard it from her
gardener, who had heard it from the road-sweeper,
who had heard it from the grocer’s
man, who had heard it from my cook, that I
had a huge shell weighing half-a-hundredweight,
covered with venomous spikes, all deadly poison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
that had dropped down the chimney right into
the centre of the kitchen fire, where it had been
found, still hissing, when they went to rake out
the ashes in the morning.</p>

<p>I didn’t display the fragment to my neighbour,
nor to subsequent callers; it is such a pity
to rob people of happiness. I merely said I
thought it better to keep it well away from all
vibration, as so far it hadn’t exploded. And
one and all assured me I was very wise, and
remembered pressing engagements elsewhere.</p>

<p>I reached the zenith of my fame when a
police inspector, accompanied by a subordinate,
rang the front door bell, and understood that I
had in my possession a portion of a Zeppelin
that had foundered on my lawn. It appeared
that he had been up all night, and had worn
out miles of shoe leather, hunting for the missing
half of that Zeppelin; and had I the gondola as
well? He seemed to suspect that I might be
holding that back in order to have it stuffed and
put under a glass shade in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>He looked disappointed when I showed him
the fragment of iron; said they had plenty of
bits that size; but he admitted that none of
them had a spike like that at one end, and
darkly hinted that it might be just the missing
link they were looking for. Then he and the
subordinate tenderly carried it away between
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>We all intend to visit the War Museum
later on. Personally, I’m very keen to see what
they ticket it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nevertheless, when each little excitement
subsided, reaction set in, and Abigail’s spirits
promptly dropped to zero. But at length a
post card arrived in time to save her (and us)
from utter collapse, and the bath-taps were
once more polished to the tune of “Days and
moments quickly flying.”</p>

<p>Thus, as I have already stated, winter
merged into spring; and then spring made way
for early summer (as I’ve known it do before),
and we racked our brains to find a suitable
substitute for pork pie.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, we had departed months ago from
the “nothing but cake” rule. We decided that
a thin, anæmic-looking young man (as per the
photographic group) needed still more feeding
up, and there wasn’t a sufficiency of body-building
material in modern cake, as everyone
knows who has sampled war-flour, even with
currants <i>as well</i> as carraways. So the Head of
Affairs and I stoically relinquished the one thin
slice of breakfast bacon that we had shared
between us each morning, and devoted the proceeds
to pork pies for the Navy—in accordance
with the highest ideals of the Food Controller.</p>

<p>But, as every good housewife knows, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
mustn’t feed your family—let alone your friends—on
pork pie when there isn’t an R in the
month; and with April nearing its end, and
May looming, what was to take its place? As
cook said, you are so dreadfully handicapped
when you have to sew up your parcel in calico;
you can’t send soused mackerel, or Welsh rabbit
with Red Tape tied round you like that!</p>

<p>Abigail suggested potted shrimps; but cook
scornfully reminded her that seafaring men,
living in the midst of shrimps and salt fish all
their days, weren’t likely to hanker after it
at meal times. We compromised on savoury
cheese patties—a come-down after the pork pie,
we admitted; only we could think of nothing
else equally nutritive and seasonable.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when I ordered extra cheese
to be sent weekly to meet the naval demands
(and up to that time I hadn’t seen any rules
for rationing cheese), the Stores “greatly regretted,”
etc., but there was a scarcity at the
moment; they could let me have a tin of
golden syrup, however, or, they had a fair stock
of candles.</p>

<p>So we removed cheese from our upstairs
dietary, consoling ourselves with the thought
that, at best, it was only half a course.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was pleasant to know that the
fleet had voted the cheese patties “A 1,” due, so
cook said, to the fact that she had told Dick to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
put the patties into a <i>slow</i> oven for ten or twelve
minutes before eating, as “it made all the
difference.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was beginning to get nervy with the strain
of it all. You see, if a letter delayed in coming,
then the question arose: Did they like the last
parcel? or, had we sent, by chance, something
they didn’t care for? And then my household
assistants looked darkly at me; <i>I</i> was to blame
for ever having suggested lemon curd tartlets.
As Abigail said, probably lemon didn’t agree
with Dick, it didn’t always with thin people.</p>

<p>Cook acquiesced, adding that you never can
tell! There was her eldest sister’s husband, a
perfect terror for temper; yet look what he
saved her in doctor’s bills—he might have had
epileptic fits instead!</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was her uncle (no
relation to her really, only her aunt’s husband,
and second husband at that), do what you would,
you couldn’t rouse him to take an interest in his
food or anything else. Her poor aunt had spent
a little fortune on medicine; and as bright a
house as you could want, not shut off with a
whole lot of garden like my house, but nice and
close on to the pavement, with heaps of traffic
going by. And exactly opposite, the broken
railings that the motor-van ran into and killed
the driver; heaps of people came to look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
place Sunday afternoons. But her uncle never
took a bit of notice of it.</p>

<p>No, you <i>never</i> can tell!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All the same, I felt guilty, and began to
wonder how long I should be able to hold out!
And then——</p>

<p>It was a lovely Saturday in May. We had
just got up from a late lunch when there came a
violent ring at the door bell. The Head of
Affairs was in the hall at the moment, and he
opened the door—to find two big sailor-men on
the doorstep, each carrying a parcel. They
inquired for me.</p>

<p>Now, like most other households, khaki and
navy blue always find a welcome at our door for
the sake of our own who are away, serving their
country, and those who have already laid down
their lives in the cause of Right and Justice.</p>

<p>So the Head of Affairs walked them straight
in upon me, without waiting to ask for their
birth certificates.</p>

<p>Did I say they were big? That isn’t the
word for it! They were more than that, they
were massive; tall, broad, well-made, and tough-looking,
with beaming, round, red faces; they
ought to have been pictured, just as they were,
for a naval recruiting poster.</p>

<p>They looked a little confused, for the moment,
at finding themselves precipitated into an unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
drawing room; but they made straight
for me, with that large, rolling stride inseparable
from the British sailor. Fortunately the room
isn’t beset in the orthodox fashion with a multitude
of bric-à-brac obstacles in the way of small
chairs and tables, for they seemed to sweep the
decks fore and aft as they strode over the carpet,
and I thought I should never find my hand
again after they had both given it a hearty shake.</p>

<p>As I looked at the big, burly fellows, both
of them well on to forty I should say, I knew
instinctively that these were our two forlorn
sailor-lads—our poor anæmic, lonely Dick, and
desolate, unsympathised-with Mick. And I
must say I never saw two men bear neglect
more bravely!</p>

<p>At first, conversation seemed all on my side:
they sat stiffly on the extreme edge of their
chairs, while Dick answered in monosyllables,
Mick seeming permanently tongue-tied! But
the Head of Affairs produced cigars warranted
to banish all nervous embarrassment and to
induce a man to sit comfortably anywhere; and
soon they were giving us details of their homes
and relatives—small things, perhaps, that are
apparently the same the world over, but mean
so much to each individual. It was still Dick
who did most of the talking. He was
undoubtedly the more attractive of the two.</p>

<p>As they were constantly making wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
clutches at their parcels which threatened to
tumble off their knees without the slightest
provocation, we offered to put them on the
table. But Dick explained, with almost child-like
confusion, that they were presents for
me and the other lady. And would I mind
taking them? He made Mick open his bundle
first. There came to light an anchor, the
like of which I had never seen before, though
I had heard of their existence. It was about
eighteen inches long, made of red velvet stuffed
with sawdust so as to form an immense pin
cushion. This was most elaborately decorated
with beads—as I thought at first—but it proved
to be pins with coloured glass heads. Lengthwise
down the anchor was this inscription,
carried out in large white-headed pins,</p>

<p class="center">
<small>“AFFECTION’S OFFERING.”</small><br />
</p>

<p>There were various ribbon bows, and ends and
tags finished off with beads, and a cord for
hanging it on the wall; altogether, it was a most
ornate, glittering creation!</p>

<p>Keeping company with the anchor was a
wooden rolling pin, that had been enamelled
a delicate pink, with hand-painted sprays of
forget-me-nots at intervals. This also had bows
and ends and a ribbon to hang it on the wall; it
likewise bore an inscription:</p>

<p class="center">
<small>“TO GREET YOU.”</small><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>While I praised the colouring, and the workmanship
of both, I promptly chose the rolling pin.</p>

<p>Mick looked a trifle disappointed, and
explained that he had really intended the
anchor for me; and thought the rolling pin
would be nice for the lady who had sent the
cakes.</p>

<p>But I clung to the rolling pin; even though
it wasn’t quite in line with my ideas of decorative
art, its sentiment was so non-committal!
Besides, I wanted Abigail to have the anchor.
Even though it be but a passing incident, it
is pleasant to receive an “affection’s offering”
occasionally, when we are young.</p>

<p>Dick’s parcel contained a large box covered
with shells, and very pretty it was. In a smaller
packet he had a coral necklace. I chose—and
praised—the box with a perfectly clear conscience
this time. You have to go to a great deal of
trouble before you can vulgarise a sea-shell; and,
fortunately, the box-maker hadn’t taken any
trouble at all; he had merely stuck them
haphazard over the cardboard lid, with a border
of small ones round the edges, and the effect
was lovely. I also knew that Abigail would
much prefer the necklace. You can’t carry a
big box about with you, to display it casually to
your friends.</p>

<p>My genuine pleasure over the presents thawed
them to such an extent, that Dick then explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
they had come round with the intention of taking
us out to a picture palace; Mick wanted to take
me, and he, Dick, would take Miss Abigail.
But, he added hesitatingly, that perhaps, after
all, that wasn’t the sort of thing I would care
about; and he looked rather beseechingly at the
Head of Affairs, hoping we should understand
what he couldn’t manage to put very clearly
into words.</p>

<p>We did understand. Gratitude is none too
plentiful in these days that we could afford to
flout it because it chanced to appear in unconventional
guise. We appreciated all that they
had planned to do by way of saying thank you
for what we had done for them—and it was little
enough we had done, when one considers our
debt to such men as these!</p>

<p>I explained that though <i>I</i> was engaged that
evening, Abigail was not; and they must now
show her those parcels.</p>

<p>She had no knowledge that they were in the
house; and you should have seen her face when
she answered the bell and I introduced Mr. Dick
and Mr. Mick.</p>

<p>In reply to my inquiries as to what she could
do in the way of hospitality, she was certain
that cook could get a really nice meal ready
for them in a few minutes; and if even cook
couldn’t she, Abigail, could, and Pamela had
just come in, and she would help; it wasn’t the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
slightest trouble—and she looked positively
radiant as she took the two in tow.</p>

<p>Having told them that we would wait on
ourselves for the rest of the day, and no one
need stay in, I was not surprised to hear a gay
party setting off a little later on; but I <i>was</i>
surprised to see that it was Pamela, and not
cook, who made the fourth in the quartette!</p>

<p>Pamela and Abigail hadn’t spoken since the
episode previously mentioned. It was curious
that she should have chanced to call for the
purpose of burying the hatchet, the very
afternoon that the “common sailors,” as she had
called them, should be there!</p>

<p>For the time of the sailors’ leave I cut the
housework down to the minimum and arranged
a week of cold dinners, Spartan-like in their
simplicity, for ourselves, so that “evenings out”
could be taken as often as my household assistants
pleased.</p>

<p>I hoped to find the kitchen radiating sunshine
in consequence. Picture my consternation,
therefore, when I came upon Abigail weeping
her eyes out in their sitting-room one afternoon
(when only half of the leave had expired too!),
the coral necklace flung into one corner, and
“affection’s offering” lying face downwards
under the table.</p>

<p>To give her opportunity to pull herself
together, I picked up the coral necklace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
inquired what Mr. Dick would be likely to
think if he saw it there. She sobbed that she
didn’t know and she didn’t care.</p>

<p>“That Pamela——” Then I saw it all in a
flash!</p>

<p>Well, to make a long story short, Pamela,
whom I had long known to be as unscrupulous
as she was good-looking, had stepped in and
carried off Dick right from under Abigail’s nose!
She had seen the two men arrive on the previous
Saturday afternoon, and that accounted for her
unexpected call. She had appropriated Dick
from the first minute she saw him.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Abigail into her handkerchief,
“just ten minutes ago, when I ran out to
post some letters, who should I see coming out
of The Gables, but Dick and that creature,
starting off together for all the world as though
they had known each other all their lives. Only
last night she had the sauce to say <i>she</i> was going
out to Canada when the war was over!”</p>

<p>I felt truly sorry for the girl, and it was some
satisfaction to me to reflect that Pamela wasn’t
quite as successful as she imagined!</p>

<p>“I don’t think she will see much of Dick
even if she does go out to Canada,” I said; “I
don’t think his wife would have a room to spare
to invite her there—with seven children. I daresay
Dick told you that the lady in the checked
apron was Mrs. Dick?” I stooped to pick up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the forlorn anchor, and dusted it most carefully,
to give her time to recover.</p>

<p>“No!” she gasped, and then went on bitterly,
“he hasn’t had a chance to tell me a <i>thing</i>, with
Pamela talking to him the whole time! But, of
course, I guessed all along he was married.” She
meant to take her disappointment bravely. “<i>I</i>
don’t want to marry anyone; men are all alike.
But it does make you wild, when——”</p>

<p>I was facing the window, but Abigail had
her back to it. Therefore she did not see what
I saw coming along the road—a large bunch of
flowers, surmounted by Mick’s round, jovial face.</p>

<p>“I think I should hang this up,” I interrupted
her, having thoroughly dusted the anchor; “after
all, Mick has no wall of his own to hang it on;
he isn’t like Dick, with a home and wife and
family—and one doesn’t get ‘affection’s offering’
every day!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that wasn’t really meant for me,”
and Abigail’s grief threatened to break out afresh.
“Mick was so taken with the lovely parcels you
sent, and he thought as you lived with me you
were a widow, and——”</p>

<p>Fortunately, I was spared the rest, for the
downstairs door bell rang with a vehemence that
was now most familiar, and Abigail, patting her
hair and her cap into shape, went smilingly
down the passage to answer the side door.</p>

<h2>XIV<br />

<small>The Bonfire</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I had</span> pointed out, quite nicely and kindly, to
Virginia, that she was not clipping the top of the
square box-tree table straight and even; and she
had pointed out, quite witheringly, to me that
she was cutting it by perspective, adding that if
I had only been privileged to learn perspective
when I was young, I should have known that
for a thing to be correct in its outlines and
proportions it must necessarily run askew and
aslant and out-at-corners, just as the top of the
box-tree table was now doing. She assured me,
however, that it would appear all right, she
thought, if I looked at it from an airship above,
with half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>And then she advised me to do a little
hoeing.</p>

<p>I ignored her sarcasm, knowing full well that
a pair of shears, applied by amateur hands to
tough overgrown greenstuff, is apt to provoke
cutting remarks when the wielder has got to the
moist stage and the hedge is looking like a
ploughed field.</p>

<p>You see, there was an inwardness in her last
remark; for hoeing looks an easy, graceful, carefree
occupation—till you try it. My own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
method is distinctive; I didn’t invent it, it came
to me as a natural inspiration. I find I invariably
start to hoe with my back, doubling up
more and more, and aching more and more, as I
proceed with the hacking. Then, as I warm to
the work (and it’s very much warm as a rule), I
likewise hoe with my teeth. By the time I have
set and ground these nearly to nothing—my
hands all the while getting lower and lower down
the handle of my tool—I find myself beginning
to hoe quite viciously with my head.</p>

<p>When I have extracted all the motive power
I can from this part of me, and have projected it
so far in front of the rest of me—hoe included—that
I almost lose my balance, the only thing
left for me to do, by way of piling up yet more
energy and effort, appears to be to go down
on all fours, seeing that by this time I am
clasping the hoe handle at about a foot from the
ground.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it is just here that I usually
realize what I am doing, and I straighten my
rounded back, and undo my teeth (that doesn’t
sound polite, but you know what I mean), and
return my head to its proper place. I then
remind myself that I am not hoeing at all
scientifically, that most of the energy I have
been putting forth has been waste—because misdirected—force.</p>

<p>Whereupon I stand at ease, and other things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
like that. Maintaining the upright as far as I
can, I take hold of the top end of the long
handle of my weapon, and, still keeping quite in
the perpendicular, I merely hoe with my arms,
thus saving the rest of me quite a considerable
number of unclassified aches. So long as I can
remember to keep my vertebræ like this, all is
well, and I really get through a fair amount of
work. But, alas, I soon forget.</p>

<p>One thing I have never yet managed to do is
to keep cool and collected, my misfortune being
that I boil up so soon. My hat gets out of
angle, my hair flattens out where it ought to be
wavy, and waves around where it ought to lie
flat; and—worst of all—it ceases to worry me
that these things are so.</p>

<p>And then I open a periodical wherein some
unknown celebrity has been photographed “at
home”; and she is sure to be shown “in the
garden,” where, behold! you see her in the airiest
of fashionable nothings in the way of a white
frock, accompanied by a ten-guinea hat, a twenty-guinea
dog, and a sixpence-halfpenny trowel—all
worn with consummate photographic grace,
as she artlessly sets to work to transplant a hoary
wistaria that has smothered the (photographer’s)
verandah for fifty years, explaining to the interviewer,
meanwhile, how she simply adores
gardening, how she gets all her ideas for the
dresses she wears in the third act from her pet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
bed of marigolds, and how she never dreams of
taking part in a first night performance without
having previously run the lawn-mower twice
round the gravel paths.</p>

<p>Clever creature; you don’t wonder she is
labelled a celebrity; any woman who can keep
that hat on while using that trowel, has accomplished
something!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I didn’t feel like hoeing just then, no matter
what the cost of my gardening outfit. The
moment seemed to call for non-strenuous occupation
that would admit of leisurely movement
and unlimited pauses with nothing doing—which
is what I find a mind like mine requires.</p>

<p>Of course there was plenty of hoeing waiting
to be done, there always is; I never knew a soil
so chock-full of weed-seeds as ours seems to be,
and I never knew a place where folks are so little
worried by them. Where things grow as easily as
they do about our hills and valleys (and where the
angle of the garden is just what ours is), you will
find that the native reduces land-labour to the
minimum, and nothing is disturbed unless absolutely
necessary. Reasonably, if you have left
the hoe at the top of the garden, and the top is
a hundred feet above the bottom of the garden
where you are standing, you think twice before
you climb up and fetch it.</p>

<p>As one result of this universal conservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
of energy, our local nettle crop is one of the
finest in the kingdom, I verily believe.</p>

<p>“Why are those things left standing in every
field corner?” I asked a farmer on one occasion,
pointing to the usual grey-green waving jungle
of weeds.</p>

<p>“They nettles?” he questioned, in surprise;
“well, what’s the good of wasting attention on
’em? They don’t hurt no one!”</p>

<p>Incidentally I may say it is always well to
criticize the methods employed on other people’s
land rather than those practised on your own,
since most right-minded employés resent any
implication, no matter how politely you wrap it
up, that improvement is possible; and if you
question the why and wherefore of anything, it
may be mistaken for fault-finding in this imaginative
age. Hence, unless the handy man chances
to be one of exceptional make up, I go farther
afield when gleaning information.</p>

<p>One day I watched a man very leisurely inspecting
a thistle in a meadow by the weir, and
then, with a deliberation that was most restful to a
harried, hustled, war-time Londoner, he tenderly
and carefully cut it off near the ground with a
scythe. After he had decapitated about twenty
thistles in this way, he naturally needed a little
time for recuperation, and sat down on the river
bank to meditate. I hadn’t liked to interrupt
him when he was working, because so far as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
could roughly estimate, there were thirteen
thousand four hundred and fifty-three thistles in
the meadow—approximately, you understand—and
we don’t work according to trade union
hours here; sometimes we start an hour later
and leave off an hour earlier, and miss out
several in between. But since he had evidently
reached his rest-hour—and remembering that
one of my own fields was plentifully dotted with
thistles at the moment, and feeling quite equal
myself to that gentle picturesque swish of the
scythe—I asked him whether that process killed
the thistle right out? (My business instinct forbade
my wasting time on the job if it would all
have to be done over again later on.)</p>

<p>No, he said, he didn’t think as how it
would kill the thistles right out.</p>

<p>Then why did he do it that way? I asked,
instead of spudding the thing right up by the
root?</p>

<p>“Well”—and he scratched his head thoughtfully—“doing
it like this jest diskerridges of ’em
a bit, and isn’t sech a deluge o’ trouble as mooting
’em right out would be.” And with that he
promptly dropped thistles, and proceeded to
discuss the fiendishness of the Germans.</p>

<p>He had a long talk (there wasn’t room for
me to say anything), and gave recipes for annihilating
completely everything connected with
them (excepting thistles; I presume they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
some; they deserve a good crop, anyhow),
finishing up with—</p>

<p>“But thur—what I says about ’em I won’t
exackly repeat in yer presence, m’m; for my
wife often says to me, ‘It won’t do nobody no
pertickler good,’ she says, ‘if you gets yerself shut
out o’ Heaven by yer langidge,’ she says, ‘just
to spite they Huns, what don’t even <i>hear</i> it!’”</p>

<p>For a full two minutes he worked that
scythe with real zest, as though onslaughting the
enemy.</p>

<p>Perhaps his method is right (in regard to
thistles, I mean), perhaps it is wrong; I’ve
never gone sufficiently deep into the subject
to be competent to pass an opinion. But I do
know that the larger proportion of handy men
who have honoured me with their patronage
(though there are conspicuous exceptions) invariably
weed on these lines of least resistance,
and “jest diskerridge ’em”—though I own it
takes a lot to discourage <i>our</i> weeds!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not feeling like diskerridging weeds at the
moment, I asked Ursula to suggest some occupation
for my idle hands, though I didn’t put
it like that; I inquired which of the many jobs
needing urgent attention I had better tackle
next. (It came to the same thing in the end;
but instead of advertising my natural indolence,
I hoped it would convey an impression that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
was rushing pell-mell through an endless succession
of tasks.)</p>

<p>Ursula was sitting on a pile of logs under a
big fir tree inside the orchard gate—oh yes,
there are firs in the orchard, and lilacs, and
daffodils, and snowdrops, and a huge Wellingtonia,
and a trickle of water with forget-me-nots
and mint on its brink; we’re not at all particular
about classification. She was darning a stocking,
and it seemed a lengthy job. Not that there
was any large, vulgar gash in the stocking; it
was merely suffering from general war-time
debility, and was one of those that you can go
on and on darning, and still find more thin places
to run up and down.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed what a snare a
stocking of this description can be? You can
sit at it for an hour or so, until it seems easier
to go on darning it than to bestir yourself to do
anything else. In the end, you haven’t accomplished
much, considering the time you’ve been
about it, but you have acquired a large dose of
the virtuous and exemplary feeling that is always
the outcome of stocking-darning.</p>

<p>Ursula had got like that, though I wouldn’t
have you think I under-estimated her efforts, for
it was my apparel she was darning.</p>

<p>“I often think that a garden embodies all the
philosophy of life,” she replied to my query, in
a detached way, as she closely inspected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
stocking foot drawn over her hand, in order to
pounce upon any further signs of impending
dissolution.</p>

<p>“I seem to fancy I’ve heard that——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve no doubt someone has said it
before me. I’ve noticed over and over again
that people plagiarize my really cleverest remarks
before I’ve actually had time to say them
myself; and I think something ought to be
done to prevent the infringement of copyright
in this barefaced way. But all the same, whether
anyone has, or has not, already helped themselves
to this unique creation of my brain, the fact
remains that I thought it out for myself, alone
and unaided. And the more I meditate upon
it, the more I notice what heaps of things in the
garden resemble life.”</p>

<p>“As for example——?”</p>

<p>“Well, slugs, for instance, and the bindweed,
and the rabbits, and the broad beans. They all
seem to typify that here we have no abiding
anything.”</p>

<p>I agreed mournfully, as I thought of the
succulent, hopeful-looking scarlet runners that
the slugs had eaten right through the tender
main stems close to the ground. It was a sad
awakening for us the day we found a few score
of limp and dying remains, where over-night we
had watered as promising a row of youngsters
as one could have wished to see. To our grieving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
spirits, it seemed as though it wouldn’t have
been nearly so bad if they had eaten the leaves
and left us the stems, at least more leaves might
have grown, whereas now——!</p>

<p>And the bindweed—where could you find a
more striking analogy to original sin? Flaunting
beautiful flowers (which I greatly love), yet all
the while spreading wicked roots out of sight,
choking everything it lays hold of, turning up in
the most unlooked-for places—but there is no
need to write more under this heading; a healthy
crop of bindweed (and I never knew one that
wasn’t most irritatingly healthy) could give points
to a preacher every Sunday in the year, and then
have enough to spare for the week-night services.
And when he had done with bindweed, he could
start afresh on mint.</p>

<p>Rabbits, again, are dear things, with an
appeal that is quite different from that of any
other of the wild things. Sometimes in the
past, when I have been doomed to sit for an
hour or so in the airlessness and weariness of
crowded hall or place of entertainment, or in
the loneliness of a congested social function,
where everybody is too buzzingly busy with
“being social” to have time to say a word to
anyone, I just switch my mind right off the
glare and the heat and the stuffiness and the
superficiality and the heartlessness, and take a
look at the little orchard adjoining the cottage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
garden, and for just a minute I watch the
rabbits, nibbling the grass, sitting up on their
hind legs to get a better view of any possible
enemy-approach, and scampering back to cover
in the coppice with a bobbing of white tails, at
the least suspicion of danger. To a woman
there is something very touching about the
timidity of these little brown things. I always
wish I could make them understand that I am
their friend and not their enemy—but this is a
difficult matter, because there is the small white
dog to be considered in the compact, and there
is no sentimentality about him where rabbits are
concerned!</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be without these little furry
families in the coppice, but oh, I do wish they
would leave the young cabbages alone, or at any
rate spare the tenderest of the green leaves! It
is a bit damping even to ardour like ours to be
greeted, when we arrive from town, by a gardener
waving a deprecating hand over rows of hardy
cabbage stumps bereft of leaves. At such times
it seems as though it wouldn’t have been nearly
so bad if they had eaten the stems and left us
the leaves, at least we could have cooked them,
whereas now——!</p>

<p>Rabbits certainly emphasize the fact that
life grows thistles as well as figs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With regard to the beans, it is difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
be philosophical. I can be to some extent
resigned when my misfortunes are handed out
to me by Nature, but it is a different thing
when they are manufactured for me (at my
expense, too) by my fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>On the whole, I cannot speak too highly of
the men who have worked for me about the
Flower-patch; I have been exceedingly well
served, but now and again one comes upon misfortune,
and on one occasion I found I had
engaged an Ananias of the most proficient
type. During his brief <i>régime</i> the weeds thrived
apace, while the choicest bulbs and flowers took
on a world of diskerridgement. When the
black pansies, and the heliotrope Spanish iris
feathered with white and yellow, and the rare
delphiniums, and the yellow arum lily disappeared
at one fell swoop, Ananias shook his
head sadly and put their defalcation down to the
rush of the rain and the angle of the earth.</p>

<p>“Everything do simply run off this soil!” he
explained.</p>

<p>Quite true; it certainly did. And two legs
invariably ran with it.</p>

<p>And the vegetables seemed as subject to
diskerridgement as the flowers, though it was
always referred to as “blight.”</p>

<p>There were the broad beans, for instance;
I had given him two quarts of seed, and indicated
where I would like them planted. They were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
special prize strain that had been sent to me by
a famous firm of seedsmen, who had been moved
to this generous deed on reading some of the
chronicles of the Flower-patch when they were
first published in <i>The Woman’s Magazine</i>. The
head of the firm wrote me that they were a new
mammoth variety, and they would be pleased
if I would try them in my cottage garden.</p>

<p>We planned great things when those broad
beans should be ready. Two quarts would make
about ten rows, we reckoned, quite a goodly
plantation for us; and we decided that as we
should have plenty, considering our small household,
we would be extravagant and gather our
first dishful when they were quite young and in
that deliciously tender state that is unknown to
the town dweller, who seldom sees a broad bean
till it is a tough old patriarch, and in such a
condition considers it a coarse vegetable.</p>

<p>It was a cold day in February when I handed
the seed to Ananias; we were returning to
London the same day, so we beguiled part of
the long journey discussing whether that first
dish should be accompanied by parsley sauce
and boiled ham, or whether to fry the ham and
have the broad beans given one turn in the
frying-pan after they were boiled.</p>

<p>The subject seemed more and more vital the
further we got along the road, for we couldn’t
get luncheon baskets (no, not the War; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
before that event, and due to one of the many
cheerful strikes with which our pre-war existence
was punctuated), and the bananas and Banbury
cakes we purchased <i>en route</i> seemed woefully
unsatisfying. Hence, it was pleasant, but very
tantalizing, to contemplate that dish of beans,
and we finally agreed that the ham should be
fried, and that we would dig some new potatoes
specially for the occasion. We sat and meditated
on that meal, as the winter landscape flew past
us, and the more we meditated the more
violently hungry we got.</p>

<p>You see, the beans really assumed more than
ordinary importance.</p>

<p>But alas, when bean time came, all that
decorated the bean plot was one miserable row
of wretched-looking stalks.</p>

<p>“It’s that thur blight agin,” remarked Ananias;
“I watched it a-comin’ up the valley.”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you pinch off the tops, if
they were showing blight?” I inquired; “then
they would have made fresh shoots lower down.”</p>

<p>He shook his head and looked at me pityingly:
“We don’t do our beans like that a-here.”</p>

<p>“And where are all the other rows,” I
asked; “I suppose blight didn’t carry off roots
and all of the remainder?”</p>

<p>“No, ’twere slugs, I warrant, or birds, or
else the seed were stale, maybe.”</p>

<p>Ursula carefully turned over the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
ground later on, but never a glimmer of a
benighted bean did she find.</p>

<p>Still, Ananias was, as usual, quite willing
to be obliging. “My beans has done uncommon
well this year,” he continued. “It’s jest all
accordin’ how it takes ’em; sometimes mine
does well and t’other people’s doesn’t; and then
agin t’other people’ll have a fine crop and I
won’t have a bean. I can let you have some o’
mine if you like. I know you’re powerful fond
o’ broad beans. I allus say you’re jest like my
missus.” (I’m sorry I haven’t a portrait of stout,
unwashed, sixty-five-year-old Sapphira to reproduce;
without it you cannot possibly understand
how pleased I was!)</p>

<p>He brought over half a bushel, explaining
that he had to charge twopence a pound more
than other people, as these were specially large
and good yielders, that were expensive in the
first place.</p>

<p>They were remarkably fine beans, indeed as
fine as I have ever seen; and I wrote to the
firm of seedsmen and told them their mammoth
variety had proved all they claimed for it.</p>

<p>I conclude the miserable row in my garden
was a twopenny packet bought from the travelling
huckster who peddles seeds around the
villages at suitable seasons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These instances are sufficient to indicate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
trend of Ursula’s thoughts when she started to
philosophize on the garden. She interrupted her
valuable remarks, however, to exclaim: “Do
look at that wench!” And Virginia might well
be looked at! Her exertions had turned her the
colour of a peony; down her face streamed
copious “extract of forehead.” The clipping
mania had got thorough hold of her, and she
was trying to trim every hedge about the place,
leaving in her wake a trail of clippings for someone
else to clear up—as is the way with all
first-class amateurs.</p>

<p>The next task pointed out itself. Ursula
got a birch broom, while I trundled the wheelbarrow
out of the tool barn; and seeing that
there was already a pile of greenstuff waiting
disposal, I started a bonfire, while Ursula swept
up and supplied extra fuel.</p>

<p>I feel sorry for the town dweller; he knows
nothing of the real charm of a bonfire. All too
often the word stands to him for nothing more
than a mass of damp and decaying leaves that
simply won’t burn. He can only attend to it
after his return from business, unless he be one
of the favoured few in town who have gardens
sufficiently large to allow of their keeping regular
gardeners. And unfortunately the lighting restrictions
of the present day give no real scope
to the bonfire maker—even if he has anything
worth burning. His dank mass smoulders to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
death, or he adds paraffin to encourage it, and
the neighbours close their windows with meaning
violence, while the parish reeks of the obnoxious
odour. Seldom has he air enough to fan anything
like a good fire; and at length, after
burning the dozenth newspaper, and listening to
minute statistical particularization on the part of
his wife regarding the present price of matches,
collectively and individually (with deviations <i>re</i>
sultanas, lemon soles, kitchen tea, coal-cards,
sugar for the charwoman, ½<i>d.</i> per lb. for delivery,
soda, a financial comparison of pre-war sirloin
with modern soup-bones, and the antiquity of
the new-laid hen), he flings himself disgustedly
indoors again, depositing a layer of greasy town-garden
soil and dead leaves on the door-mat, and
perchance trailing it up to his dressing-room.</p>

<p>The town bonfire is usually an abomination;
the country bonfire is often sheer delight; and
the reason for this difference is due to the fact
that the shut-in nature of the average town back-plot
seldom supplies the good current of air that
a bonfire needs to get it going full-swing; and
more than this, the refuse that collects in a
town garden is often sooty, unsanitary and malodorous.
Whereas in the country there is a great
diversity of stuff to be burnt, and much of it is
delightfully aromatic. Also, the wind that
sweeps continually over our hills, for instance,
dries up the rubbish pile—unless it be actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
raining; we seldom get that dank sodden stuff
that is the bane of the town gardener. We can
always get a current of air, if not a stiff breeze,
to fan the first stages; and being unhampered
by the claims of city offices, we can start it in the
morning, and keep it going the whole day long.
Our only trouble is to get the red-hot mass to
slumber through the night; it has such a trick
of suddenly bursting out again about 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
lighting up the cottage in the dark, and flaming
forth a vivid beacon worthy of the men of
Harlech, and recalling stirring scenes in old
romance—only the local constabulary have no
poetic leanings, and merely see in it a case for a
£10 fine under the Defence of the Realm Act.</p>

<p>I started the bonfire—not with newspapers,
these are far too few and precious; why, our
very paper bags are smoothed out and treasured
in a dresser drawer; some done-with straw and
dry leaves make a good beginning, with some of
the dead twigs from the larches. If there are
laurel clippings to put on next, and there usually
are, then success is assured.</p>

<p>Soon the flames were licking up my initial
work, and I proceeded to pile on hedge trimmings,
the sweepings-up of an apple-tree that
had blown down and been sawn up—and how
sweet they made the air! Thistles, nettles,
brambles, surplus raspberry canes that spring up
everywhere, a holly-bush that had lately been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
cut down, worthless gooseberry bushes, piles of
ivy that had been cut from the walls, more
barrow-loads of stuff tipped on by Ursula—how
the laurel flared and the yew crackled, and one’s
eyes smarted as the smoke swept round like a
whirlwind and enveloped one at times! I am a
great believer in the burning of all refuse vegetation;
it does away with so much blight and
vermin and plant disease, and clears out mosquito
haunts, and is generally sanitary.</p>

<p>Virginia had betaken herself to cooler climes,
but Ursula and I worked at that heap, forking
on new stuff to stop up flame bursts, till we too
were shedding dew from our foreheads, and our
hands were almost sore with wielding the heavy
forks.</p>

<p>Yet a fascination keeps you at it, till you are
smoke-dried and fire-toasted and arm-aching to
the last degree. When the shades of evening
finally call you in (as a rule, meals are most
perfunctory when a bonfire is in progress) you
are saturated from head to foot with the bonfire,
your very hair has absorbed the time-old pungent
odour of the smoke of forest fires.</p>

<p>And maybe months and months afterwards
you open a seldom used wardrobe, where old
gardening gear and shabby mackintoshes are
kept, and suddenly you are overwhelmed with
the scent of burning pear and birch leaves and
yew; the lure of the woods calls aloud to you;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
you feel the sweep of the winds on the hills
alternating with the great swirls of grey-blue
bonfire smoke; the cramped town vanishes, and
you are in free open spaces once more——</p>

<p>And all because a certain tweed skirt, or
light gardening coat is hanging in the corner of
the wardrobe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If you want a bonfire with a delicious scent
that will haunt you with a poignant memory
long after its ashes have gone the way of all
things, pile up dead apple leaves and twigs,
pine needles, beech leaves, the trimmings of the
sweet bay bushes, brambles, rose-stalks and
larch—and the incense of the forest will be
yours, bringing with it a mystic sense of nearness
to primæval things that no perfume sold in
cut-glass bottles has yet been able to conjure up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We didn’t wait till sun-down, however, that
day; for we were in the most thrilling part of
the afternoon forking-up, and our complexions
were at their very, <i>very</i> worst, when Abigail
tripped out and announced:</p>

<p>“The Rector.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, you needn’t worry
about your appearance, ma’am. Miss Virginia’s
talking to him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, she’s changed <i>her</i>
dress, and is telling him just what you look like.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>




<h2>XV<br />

<small>The Meeting at the
Cottage</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">I have</span> been wondering,” the Rector began, “if
it would be possible for you to let us have a
Temperance Meeting here in your cottage? I
feel sure it would be productive of good, and we
sadly need more aggressive Temperance work in
this parish. And a little gathering in a private
house would be more of a novelty than one held
in the Parish Room, or at the Rectory.”</p>

<p>“A Temperance Meeting!” I repeated, rather
hesitatingly, I confess. I knew well enough that
there was work waiting to be done in this
direction, but whether those who most needed
reforming could be got inside my door was quite
another matter.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I am not meaning an evening
meeting for the purpose of reaching the men
themselves,” the Rector explained. “My idea
is to have an afternoon Ladies’ Meeting to
discuss more particularly the question of prohibition.
We might eventually get up a week
of meetings in various parts of the district. Only
it all wants talking over. There are a number of
ladies who would be willing to aid, if only some
definite scheme were put before them. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
would issue the invitations, I know they would
be only too pleased to come; and we could
possibly get a committee appointed as the initial
step in the proceedings.”</p>

<p>I saw at once that the idea was a practical
one. Quite a goodly handful of ladies would be
available from houses dotted here and there upon
the hillside. So we made a list of those living
near enough to me to be invited.</p>

<p>“Now, have we overlooked anybody?” I
said finally, going down the list once more. It
included the Manor House and one or two other
large country houses where I knew the people
would be sympathetic, the rest being cottage-residences
and small places inhabited by people
of the educated classes, who kept simple, unassuming
establishments—some from choice,
some because their means were small. In several
cases the ladies dispensed with any servant, finding
that life’s problems and breakages and fingermarks
were much reduced when they did the
work themselves!</p>

<p>“By the way, there are two visitors in the
place at present, who would like to come, I am
sure,” said the Rector, “One is a very nice girl,
who has been doing V.A.D. work since the
beginning of the War. She is here recruiting
after a nervous breakdown; and is boarding at
the Jones’s farm—I know she would appreciate
an invitation.” I duly wrote down her name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the other, Miss Togsie, is a literary
lady, and is lodging with old Mrs. Perkins; do
you happen to know her name?”</p>

<p>I had never heard it before.</p>

<p>“Ah! neither had I. But then that would
not be remarkable. Only she seemed surprised
to think I did not know of her, though, so far as
I can ascertain, she has never actually published
anything. She is engaged on some book of
research, which she regards as an important
contribution to the literature of the times, though
for the moment the subject has escaped my
memory. She is so exceedingly anxious to
meet you; in fact, she—er—suggested that I
should take her with me to call on you; but I
told her that you come down here for rest and
quiet, and to escape the conventionalities of
society. She is rather a—er—persistent lady,
however; and she says her admiration for you is
unbounded. So possibly, if you have no objection,
it might make a pleasant interlude if she
were invited also.”</p>

<p>I was not very anxious to have her, but I
agreed, as the Rector seemed to wish it. Still, I
am afraid my smile was a trifle ironical, as I tailed
the list with her name.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the very day of the meeting
was the one suddenly selected by Abigail’s sister
for her wedding; of course, I insisted that
Abigail must not miss the function, and sent her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
back to town the day before. But when the
preparations were divided between the three of
us, they did not amount to much in the way of
extra work; and Ursula made herself responsible
for the fresh relays of tea that would be necessary
for new arrivals.</p>

<p>As is the custom in the country, everybody
walked round the garden to see how the things
were coming on, and we all compared notes with
each other’s gardens, and, of course, everybody
complimented me on the forwardness of my
things—as in duty bound, seeing they were
drinking my tea!</p>

<p>The V.A.D. proved a delightful girl, very
nervous at first, but very appreciative. And as
all my other visitors were fully engaged in
chatting together in twos and threes, I devoted
myself to the shy outsider. The Literary Lady
had not yet appeared.</p>

<p>“I come up every day and look over the wall
at your flowers,” the girl said. “I believe
they’ve done me far more good than the tonic
I’ve been taking.”</p>

<p>“I invariably take a dose of them myself,
when I’m run down,” I replied. We were
wandering around the narrow paths, between the
beds edged with pieces of grey stone. The paths
were beginning to be weedy; and the garden
was a mixture of early and late spring flowers,
owing to the undue length of the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>But for the V.A.D. there were no imperfections.
“I’ve never seen cowslips like these
before,” and she stooped and touched them
lovingly. “Those mahogany-coloured ones are
so rich. And I like the deep reddy-orange ones
too. Oh—I like them all!” she added, with a
sigh of pleasure. “And when I was ill in
London, before they sent me down here, I felt
as though I should die if I couldn’t get away
somewhere, where there were flowers and sunshine
and where the trees and foliage were fresh
and clean. Wherever I looked there were grey
skies, and dingy houses, and discoloured paint,
and dirty streets, and miserable-looking squares
and sooty stuff that it was pitiful to call grass,
and smoke and mud all the same colour and
equally stupefying. Do you think that dirt can
get on people’s nerves?”</p>

<p>I nodded. Don’t I know only too well how
the grime and gloom and all-pervading sordidness
of big cities can get on one’s nerves! Don’t
I know how in time they seem to corrode
one’s very soul, and dull one’s vision, till faith
itself can become clouded, and hope goes, and all
one’s work seems of no avail! But the merciful
Lord has provided an antidote. It was a Tree
He showed at the waters of Marah; and the
leaves of the Tree are for the healing of the
nations in more senses than one.</p>

<p>The girl continued her confidences: “When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
I lay awake at nights with insomnia, I used to
shut my eyes and think out the garden I wanted
to find. It wasn’t a grand garden, or a gorgeous
one that I used to plan—carpet bedding and
terraces with beds of geraniums and peacocks
would have tired me to arrange in proper style
just then. The garden I wanted was the sort of
happy place where flowers seem to grow of their
own accord with no one to worry them about
tidy habits!</p>

<p>“And then, it was quite remarkable, the day
after I arrived here, I chanced upon the lane
leading to your cottage, and there I saw the very
garden I had been so longing for, and the masses
of flowers and colour I had been quite hungry to
see. I could hardly tear myself away from the
little gate. Of course, the florists wouldn’t think
much of me for saying it, but although I admire
with real wonder the magnificent blooms they
exhibit at shows, I would rather have that piece
of rocky wall, with its wallflowers on the top,
than the most expensive orchids they could show
me. But perhaps all this seems rather childish
to you?”</p>

<p>Yet it didn’t! I knew exactly what she
meant; and every flower-lover will understand it
too. There are times when I go a good deal
farther than the V.A.D., and actually object to
some of the improvements on Nature horticulturists
think they can make. What is gained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
trying to produce rhododendrons looking like
gypsophila, while at the same time they are
trying to get gypsophila looking like pæonies?
What purpose is served in the modern craze for
getting every flower to look like any other flower
excepting itself? While I don’t mean to imply
that I am so narrow as to object to attempts at
horticultural development, there certainly are
limits to desirable expansion—as Shakespeare
very well knew.</p>

<p>But I had no time to say more, for as she
was speaking I caught sight in the distance of a
stalwart, aggressive-looking female, with an armful
of MSS. and walking-stick clasped to her
waistbelt, and clad in a long, loose, tussore silk
coat (we were all wearing them short at the
moment) that she clutched to her chest with her
other hand, as it had lost its fastenings, and was
threatening to blow away. Her hat was of the
fluffy “girlie” description, somewhat bizarre in
shape, which looked preposterous above the
lady’s mature locks, more especially as she had
put it on hind part front, not even bothering
herself to ascertain its compass points.</p>

<p>Miss Togsie was blandly unconscious of any
incongruity in her personal appearance, and
entered the gate with the assured step of “mind
quite oblivious of matter.” Precipitating herself
on Ursula—the only hatless person in
sight, hence evidently not a fellow guest—she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
exclaimed in a strident voice, “The Editor of <i>The
Woman’s Magazine</i>, I believe? <i>So</i> glad to meet
you. I’ve been <i>longing</i> to know you. <i>So</i> kind
of you to ask me to this <i>delightful</i> gathering——”
etc.</p>

<p>Now, as I told Ursula later, if she had been
a true friend, she would merely have smiled
sweetly and wafted the new arrival into the
house, and silenced her with refreshments.
Instead of which, she meanly disclaimed all
editorial connections, and piloted her up the
garden to me. Whereupon we began all over
again. I waited patiently till she reached a
semicolon, and then invited her to come indoors
and have some tea.</p>

<p>“No tea for <i>me</i>, thank you!” she exclaimed,
in tones of stern disapproval. “I never touch
tea.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would like some milk and a
sandwich?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I never take flesh foods of any
description. I adhere strictly to the fruit diet
which Nature has so bountifully provided for
our use. If you happen to have a banana, or a
few muscatels——” I hadn’t.</p>

<p>“It’s of no consequence,” she said, with an
air of kindly tolerance for my shortcomings.
“I’m perfectly happy here under the blue dome
of heaven.” My other guests seemed to have
had enough of her already, and were making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
their way towards the house, as it was nearly
time to start the meeting; but Virginia linked
her arm in that of the V.A.D., and followed
close at my heels; for her, the lady promised to
be interesting.</p>

<p>“Oh, what adorable kroki!” the newcomer
went on, without any break, apostrophising a few
late crocuses that were already looking jaded.
“And those daisies! I do so <i>love</i> daisies, don’t
you? ‘Wee modest crimson-tipped flowers’—you
remember the poet’s allusion, of course?
So appropriate.” The flowers she was pointing
at with her knotty walking-stick were particularly
large, buxom-looking red double daisies, a
prize variety, that not even the imagination of
a poet could have described as “wee”!</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful how literature opens one’s
eyes to the beauties of nature. I always say
‘Read the poets,’ then it will not matter whether
you stay in town or country, nature will be an
open book to you.” (Undoubtedly the Literary
Lady had arrived; and she was bent either on
improving or on impressing us!) “The poets
take you into the very <i>heart</i> of things. ‘A
primrose by a river’s brim’; where can you find
a truer picture of the simple wayside flower?
And isn’t that an exquisite line, ‘A rose by any
other name would smell as sweet’? I entirely
agree with Shakespeare in this” (which was nice
of her!); “it is just as I was saying, it really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
doesn’t matter whether you know a single flower
individually—or whether you have ever seen a
flower, in fact—all nature can be yours. I consider
it criminal to neglect the poets. Wherever
the eye wanders,” she went on, “it recalls some
great truth that has been crystallised for us by
literary men” (evidently the flowers themselves
were of small count; all that mattered was what
pen-and-ink could make out of them).</p>

<p>“And Ladysmocks all silver white.” It was
evident that she was warming to the work and
going farther afield, for here the stick took a
dangerous sweep round in mid-air (Virginia
saved her head by dodging it), and was now
pointing into the copse the other side of the
garden-wall, where the anemones were still in
bloom. “I simply revel in Lady’s Smocks,
don’t you?” she said ardently to Virginia, and
then smiled expansively into the copse, though
there wasn’t a solitary Lady’s Smock there.</p>

<p>“For my own part, I must say I prefer
Doxies,” said Virginia sweetly. “‘The Doxy
over the dale,’ as Shakespeare so beautifully
expresses it. Don’t you just <i>love</i> them?”</p>

<p>The V.A.D. had turned her back on us and
was studying the distant hills.</p>

<p>“Virginia,” I interpolated hurriedly, for I
scented trouble immediately ahead, “isn’t that
the Rector coming up the lane? Then we
must be getting indoors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Literary Lady had not nearly said
all she had come intending to say; so she told
me as we walked to the house that she herself
was engaged on a most exhaustive literary work,
entitled, “The Cosmic Evidences of Woman’s
Supremacy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, in a blank tone of voice that
wasn’t intended to commit me to anything.
I’ve handled many similarly exhaustive MSS. in
my time, and I’ve met many authoresses of the
same, and my one terror was lest she should
start to give me a detailed synopsis of each
chapter. But fortunately we reached the house
before she could get fairly launched.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the opening hymn and prayer, the
Rector briefly sketched his idea in calling the
meeting together, and, after reminding us how
desirable it was at a time like this that some
active campaign should be set afoot to combat
the drunkenness that had been such a bane to
our land, he asked if any ladies who had suggestions
to make would kindly speak briefly and to
the point. Hardly had he sat down before the
Literary Lady was on her feet urging upon us
all the necessity for giving up our inebriate
habits! You would have thought she was
addressing loafers inside a public-house.</p>

<p>I sat as patiently as I could waiting for her
to sit down and give place to someone else, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
at least, knew whom they were addressing. But
next moment I found, to my amazement, that
she was lecturing us on the advantages of a
fruitarian diet, assuring us that most of the evils
flesh is heir to (including drunkenness) would be
done away with if we only chained our appetites
to fruit. She was blissfully unaware that the
cause of all the trouble in our district was—cider!
After every form of food that was not
fruit had been abused, she passed on—by a
transition that seemed easy to her, but unaccountable
to everyone else—to the question of
woman’s suffrage, and we learnt that another
cause for drunkenness was to be found in the
fact that women had had no votes. And then
it dawned upon me that we had let ourselves
in for an afternoon with some irresponsible
crank.</p>

<p>It really seemed as though she meant to go
on for ever. The Rector’s gentle and courteous
attempts to stem the rushing torrent were not
of the slightest avail. He tried to interpolate a
remark now and again, but she never even heard
him; she was addressing us at the very top of
her voice. Of course he ought to have stopped
her at the very outset; but then the situation
was one he had never before been called upon to
face in the whole of his seventy years; hers was
the first female voice to be raised in our parish
in defiance of the Rector!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Equally, of course, I ought to have stopped
her; but one hesitates to take the initiative in
such a case when there is a chairman, and
eventually I let matters get quite beyond me.
I did rise at the back of the room and try to ask
a few questions, but all in vain; the speaker
never paused, and at last I meekly sat down
again, while Virginia and Ursula, with the
V.A.D. between them, suffocated in their
handkerchiefs and showed distinct signs of
getting out of hand! Besides what <i>can</i> anyone
do under such circumstances? I asked Ursula,
who once attended election meetings, what it was
usual to do, and she said, “You just turn them
out when they talk too much.” But who was
to turn her out? And how do you set about it?</p>

<p>It was evident from her absurd and illogical
statements that neither the Fruitarians nor the
Woman’s Suffrage party owned her or would
have authorised her to advocate their claims.
She was merely one of those women one meets
occasionally who take up every new craze that
comes along, and get on their feet and speak
about their latest hobby, in season and out of
season, having not the slightest sense of proportion,
and of the fitness of things. Such a
woman loves to hear her own voice, and imagines
that other people love to hear it too!</p>

<p>After half an hour of this sort of thing the
lady of the Manor took her departure—not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
quietly either! As I stepped outside in the
porch to bid her a mournful “Good-bye,” she
pressed my hand and murmured—</p>

<p>“You poor dear! Do let me know who
finally chokes her!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How we should have silenced her eventually
I don’t know, but the matter was taken out of
our hands by no less important a personage
than Johnny, the boy who delivered the bread
from the village shop.</p>

<p>Unable to find any Abigail at the kitchen
door, he had come along to the other door to
know how many loaves I required. From my
seat in the room I tried to indicate, by dumb
pantomime, that I wanted one loaf; Miss Smith
caught sight of him, and remembering that she
was two miles away from any bread if he overlooked
her, she told him in a clear voice not to
forget to leave her a loaf. Then everyone else
in the room woke up to the fact that Johnny
was outside, and with one accord they all asked
him if he had remembered them, or told him
how many loaves to leave, and no one troubled
in the slightest whether it interfered with the
speaker or not. In fact, they seemed to enjoy
the clatter they were making.</p>

<p>Johnny, being attacked by so many voices at
once, stood on the doorstep and addressed the
room stolidly and respectfully—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve lef’ your loaf on the window-ledge,
Miss Primkins; an’ I put two for you in the
fork of the apple-tree, Miss Robinson, so’s the
dog can’t get at it, as he’s loose; an’ Miss Jones,
your’n is on the garden seat; and I’ve a-put
Mrs. Wilson’s a-top of the wood-pile wiv a bit
of paper under it”—(undue favouritism to
Mrs. Wilson, we all thought!)—“an’ I’ve lef’
your nutmegs and soda and coffee on the doorstep,
Miss White; and I driv a cow out of your
garden, what had got in, Miss Parker; the gate
was lef’ open; but he’s latched up all right
now——”</p>

<p>At this intelligence the room gave a general
shuffle, preparatory to a stampede. Why, a
cow might have got into every garden! Who
could tell? And only those who have cherished
gardens in the country know what terrible import
lurked in the words, “The gate was lef’ open!”</p>

<p>The Rector, seeing where matters were
trending, said we would close with a hymn.
Before he had given out more than one line,
Ursula did what she had never done before, and
has never done since—raised the tune! She
said it was sheer hysterics made her do so. At
any rate we all took it up vigorously, because
we saw the Literary Lady was trying to add a
postscript to her previous remarks. It’s true,
Ursula started us on a six-lined tune, whereas
the verses were only four lines each, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
fortunately discovered it in time, and repeated
the last two lines to save the situation.</p>

<p>The people all left hurriedly as soon as the
Benediction had been pronounced; most of
them looking unutterable things at me for
having let them in for such a time! The Literary
Lady alone seemed to have enjoyed herself,
and went away leaving the bundle of MSS.
she had brought, after telling me that she
intended to call on me the very next afternoon
and bring me “The Cosmic Evidences,” as she
felt sure it would be the very thing for my
magazine. The unkindest cut of all, however,
was the farewell remark made by the Vicar’s
niece, as she was adjusting her bonnet-strings—</p>

<p>“I can’t think why on earth you ever asked
that individual to address us; but I suppose she
is some personal friend of yours?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the two girls and I were left alone
with the general disorder that always prevails
after one’s guests have gone, Ursula made some
tea, and Virginia brought in what was left of the
festal fare, and we sat around the fire and ate in
melancholy silence.</p>

<p>“I’m going to town by the very first train
to-morrow,” I said at last.</p>

<p>“So ’m I!” fervently ejaculated the other
two in unison. “And may I never set eyes
or ears on that fruit creature again,” added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Virginia, as she set down her plate, with an air
of a pain in her chest, after her sixth cucumber
sandwich.</p>

<p>But, though I escaped the lady’s next call, I
had not got to the end of her. She sent an
avalanche of MSS. to my office, and called persistently
in person. Howbeit, she never was
troubled to walk beyond the inquiry office, and
her MSS. were always returned to her with the
utmost promptitude.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some weeks later Virginia and I, after doing
some shopping in the stores, turned into the
refreshment-room for lunch. I do not know any
place where a more varied assortment of feminine
idiosyncrasies thrust themselves upon one’s
notice than in the ladies’ luncheon-room; neither
do I know any place where you can hear, within
a given space of time, more particulars of the
births, marriages, ailments and deaths—plus a
wealth of intervening data—of people you know
nothing about, than in that self-same room.</p>

<p>We had hardly taken our seats at a table
before we were accompanying our next-door
neighbour to a dentist, she being in a state of
<i>complete</i> nervous prostration (full symptoms
given), and having four teeth extracted (<i>most</i>
obstinate one that came out in eleven separate
pieces) with gas that wouldn’t “take” (italicised
description of what the victim underwent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
was conscious of, in her half-gone condition).
After this we dallied through an exceedingly
comprehensive catalogue of what she had been
able to take in the way of nourishment since the
momentous occasion; and finally received, with
breathless interest, the important information as
to the exact date when she would be once more
fully equipped for dinner-parties.</p>

<p>On our right two more were discussing, with
gusto, the doings (none of them, apparently,
what she ought to have done) of a bride who
had recently entered their family.</p>

<p>Our own corner of the room was so engaging
that we did not notice the newcomers who were
finding seats at other tables. But suddenly,
above the general chatter, there arose the sound
of a strident voice that there was no possibility
of mistaking. Virginia and I gasped simultaneously;
and there, a short distance away
from us (though, fortunately with its back
towards us), we beheld the fluffy hat (rightside
front this time), above a screw of hair, and the
long tussore coat of recent blessed memories!
The Literary Lady had a friend with her, but
obviously the friend didn’t count for much, she
hadn’t a chance; at most she only squeezed in a
word when the other made a semi-pause for
breath. We sat spell-bound, and this is what
we heard:</p>

<p>“Now, dear, what are you going to have?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
They have soup, roast beef, roast lamb and mint
sauce, roast mutton” (and so on, she declaimed
the menu to the bitter end, while a long-suffering
waitress stood first on one tired foot
and then on the other). “Oh, but you must
have something more than a bun.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nonsense,
that was hours ago; I had mine late, too,
but I’m quite ready for lunch.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On strict
diet, are you? That doesn’t count. Specialists
always say that sort of thing; that’s what you
pay the money for; but it doesn’t follow that
you do what they say. Why, you’d starve to
death if you did, and then you’d have to go to
them again and pay another fee—though I dare
say that’s their idea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You would like a
little roast lamb? Well, I might manage a
little, too, if it is <i>very</i> hot; but I expect they’ve
only got it about lukewarm. If the roast lamb
isn’t quite &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what? It’s <i>cold?</i> All the joints
are cold? The waitress says it’s <i>cold</i>, dear!
Isn’t it simply ridiculous in a place like London
never to be able to get a hot lunch!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What?
The grill is hot? But, my good girl, I don’t
want any grill.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the soup and fish? I
don’t want either soup or fish.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, and I
don’t want hot steak-and-kidney pie. I wanted
hot roast lamb. Still, if you haven’t it, I
suppose it isn’t your fault. All the same, it does
seem as if you are—— .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sausages, did
you say? They would be rather nice. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
are <i>they</i> hot or cold, which?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Smoked??</i>
Only <i>smoked</i> sausages?? Did you ever know
such a place!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What do you say to oysters?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You thought I only took fruit? I tried
that for a little while; my last doctor but one
was very keen on it; but if you believe me, I
was losing <i>pounds</i> a week! I should have been
a perfect skeleton by now if I’d gone on. So I
went to another man, and he insisted—absolutely
<i>insisted</i> that I must take food containing a larger
percentage of proteids. And I wasn’t sorry; I
never had any faith in that fruit idea, only I met
that doctor when I was at the Hydro, and he
begged me to try it. A most charming man,
and he took the <i>greatest</i> interest in my writings;
but someone told me only last week that he has
a wife who is a positive—— .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Salmon? Is
there salmon? I didn’t notice it. That wouldn’t
be bad, would it? and the very best thing you
could have as you’re dieting; so digestible, I
always find. Now where’s that girl gone? I
declare they slip away the minute your back’s
turned, and they don’t give you a moment to
look at the menu. Is that our waitress over
there? I think it is; she has on an apron just
like the girl who was here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That’s true, now
you mention it; their aprons are all alike. Still,
I think that was the one, and she’s gone over
there on purpose to be out of reach. But I’ll go
to her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Virginia and I narrowly escaped detection,
for the Literary Lady strode across the
room, knocking down other people’s umbrellas
in passing, brushing one lady’s velvet stole from
the back of a chair, and kicking over a tray that
had been put down in, apparently, the most out-of-the-way
spot in the room. Clutching the
arm of the waitress who belonged to our table
and had no dealings with the other end of the
room, she demanded immediate service. Instinctively
Virginia and I bent our heads forward
as low as possible over our plates, and fortunately
the wide brims of our hats helped to conceal our
features. But we only breathed freely when she
returned to her seat to report to her friend—</p>

<p>“That waitress says the other girl will be
back in a minute; but I doubt it. There; now
<i>she’s</i> gone off too! Ah, here’s ours—at last!
Now, dear, you said sausage, didn’t you? Or
did we decide on oysters?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You’re right; it
was salmon. I always think that salmon—— .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
What did you say?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why, of <i>course</i>
we want bread! We couldn’t eat it without,
could we?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, I see, you mean bread or
roll? She says will you have bread or roll,
dear?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, rolls would be nice, but—— Waitress!
Not crusty ones!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, perhaps
bread <i>would</i> be softer for you under the
circumstances. Stale bread, waitress! Those
rolls are usually as hard as—— .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
we <i>had</i> better decide on what we will have to
drink. I’m going to have lime-juice. You’d
better have some too. It goes so well with
salmon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of course they have coffee, if you
really prefer it; but I do think that lime-juice—— Well,
if that girl hasn’t gone off again! They
do nothing but run about from pillar to post.
Oh, she is bringing the other things! <i>That</i> isn’t
brown bread, waitress! I said <i>brown</i> bread
surely? I <i>must</i> have said brown bread, because
I positively cannot touch anything else. Don’t
you remember I called you back and said, ‘<i>Brown</i>
bread, waitress?’ Well, if you can change it,
that’s all right. Wait a minute, though; after
all, I think I’ll have white.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, you can
leave it; but all the same, I can’t think why
people never listen to what one says.”</p>

<p>Here half the room broke out into an unconcealed
smile; <i>i.e.</i>, the half that had found it
impossible to raise their voices above hers, and so
had finally given it up as hopeless, and now
devoted themselves to listening. But all oblivious
of everything but herself, she continued—</p>

<p>“I don’t like the look of that salmon. I feel
sure it’s been frozen. Is that the best you have?
It looks to me like New Zealand or Canterbury
salmon! Really, <i>everything</i> seems to be made in
Germany nowadays, doesn’t it? And no mayonnaise.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?
It’s in the cruet? I never care for
that bottled stuff.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, yes, leave it; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
wish now that we had had oysters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s no
use offering to change it; we’ve done nothing
else so far but have wrong things brought us to
have changed—or at least it would have been
changed if I hadn’t consented to put up with the
white bread. But you can bring us some lime-juice.
Now don’t forget <i>this</i> time and bring
ginger-beer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, lime-juice for two.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But I thought you agreed to lime-juice just
now?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, have what you like by all means;
<i>I</i> don’t mind what it is; I only advised lime-juice
because coffee is so <i>very</i> bad for anyone on
diet, and you can’t be too careful; still, please
yourself, only <i>do</i> let us decide on <i>something</i>, or
she’ll be off again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That’s it, one coffee and
one lime-juice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, with plenty of milk.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Now, I wonder if that scatter-brained girl will
go and put the milk in the lime-juice?</p>

<p>“You were surprised to hear I was back in
town? I returned last week. I absolutely
couldn’t have <i>existed</i> on that benighted hill-top
another hour.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I knew the moment I set
eyes on it that it wasn’t sufficiently cooked. No
one could be expected to eat it. She must get
us something else. Waitress! This salmon
isn’t <i>half</i>-done. It’s as soft as.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, I see;
yours is hard? Well, at any rate, it isn’t what
it ought to be. Mine is quite spongy, and this
lady’s is as hard as .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the skin, is it?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this
lady’s skin is just like leather.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
had better be oysters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now I wonder how
much longer she’ll keep us waiting? But as I
was saying, they were the dullest, most bucolic
set of people I ever came across; not a thought
above their fowls and cabbages. I tried to
discuss Art and Literature with them—simple
things, not too far above their heads, you know,
just to draw them out; but they merely gazed
at me in utter blankness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, she has a
cottage there; I’d forgotten I mentioned it in
my letter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, yes, I met her; in fact she
persuaded me to address a drawing-room meeting
at her house; she got it up on purpose, hearing
I was in the district. I could ill afford to spare
the time from my book; but she wrote and
made <i>such</i> a point of it, that I could hardly
refuse without seeming rude. She invited a
number of the local people to meet me; but a
more stupid, unimpressionable collection of——
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what is she like? <i>Most</i> ordinary. As you
know, I’m endowed with unusual intuition, and
can gauge people and sum them up in a <i>moment</i>,
and I must say I found her a <i>very</i> uninteresting
person—not to say exceedingly heavy.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Which only proves,” said Virginia when we
got outside, “that even the worst of us may
profit by hearing the truth spoken in love!”</p>

<h2>XVI<br />

<small>Moon-Gold in the
Garden</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> flame of August is over all the garden, a
blaze of yellow and scarlet, orange and red, for
most of the blues and pinks go out with July,
though the lavender flowers are opening intensely
blue, and big clumps of eryngium, with
blue stems as well as blue flower-heads, make
masses of contrasting colour amidst the sunflowers,
single and double, and the eschscholtzias
and marigolds glowing golden and undaunted by
the hottest sunshine. The flowers of the Red-hot-poker
rival their namesakes; broad spreading
clumps of montbretia, each waving hundreds of
fiery orange and red blossoms, have sprung into
existence, since last we were here, from lowly
modest-looking patches of green blades.</p>

<p>The second crop of Gloire-de-Dijon roses are
out, likewise holding in their hearts remembrance
of the hot sunshine that pervades the
earth. Geraniums, turned out of doors “to get
a little air” (though there certainly isn’t much
to get just now!), are shouting aloud in pride of
their heavy, scarlet bosses. The mountain-ash
trees contribute plenty of colour, each branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
bent down with a smother of bunches of berries,
which are being eagerly devoured by blackbirds,
thrushes and hawfinches.</p>

<p>Tall red and yellow hollyhocks try to
persuade you that they are nearly as high, and
quite as brilliant, as the mountain-ash.</p>

<p>Nasturtiums trail all over the place, climbing
where there is next to nothing to support them,
with flowers so thick you lose count of the
foliage. And what a dazzling mass they make,
touched apparently with every shade of yellow
and brown and red, from blossoms of palest
primrose marked with vivid scarlet, past salmon-colour
streaked with orange, and lemon yellow
splashed with chocolate, to dark mahogany-red
smoked with deep purple-brown. They smother
weeds (that gain in impudence as the season
advances), and cover bare places where bulbs
and earlier blooming plants have died down.
They hang over the tops of walls; they crowd
the border pinks into the paths; they get mixed
up with the hedges, and surprise you by sending
out vermilion flowers at the top of a sedate old
box-tree clipped to look like a solid square table.
They run out of the little white gate into the
lane, and they creep under the rails into the
orchard. Indeed, there are times when their
exuberance almost makes one tired, more especially
if the thermometer favours the nineties!</p>

<p>The garden walls are teeming with colour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Sweet Alyssum has seeded itself wherever it can
find a spare niche—rather a difficulty, unless a
plant goes house-hunting quite early in the
season! Though the white and purple arabis
finished flowering months ago, it contributes
crimson and purple to the colour scheme, as its
foliage ripens in the hot sun.</p>

<p>Any intelligent gardener can tell me that the
top of a sunny wall is far too hot for a fuschia.
Certainly; and of course it is—especially in
August. Yet some misguided person had one
planted there—just where the wall has a break
in it, and a flight of steps leads down to the next
level. It is the lovely old-fashioned bush sort,
smothered with slender drooping blossoms; and
it reaches out long arms that arch right over the
steps, and as you go down, unless you lower
your head, you set a-tinkling scores of crimson
bells with rich blue-purple centres.</p>

<p>And people who understand all about fuchsias
glare at it severely, and then at me, and remark,
“A most unsuitable position!”</p>

<p>And where nothing else in particular is
making any sort of a show, the ubiquitous Herb
Robert spreads itself about, on the top of the
walls, or roots in crevices down the sides—it
isn’t particular where; so long as there are stones
that need clothing with loveliness, there you will
find it, laying its crimson leaves with a lacy
airiness over the stern surface of the rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The very scents of the garden are hot and
pungent, as one rubs against thyme and marjoram,
or the great sage bush that smothers one
wall. The trees of sweet bay were cut in the
morning; the rosemary bushes had to be trimmed
where their branches were lying on the ground;
someone has stepped on pieces in passing.</p>

<p>All day long the heat strikes down on the
parched, cracking earth, baking the stones,
shrivelling up any fern fronds that chance to
catch its direct rays, drying up the little brook,
and testing the powers of endurance of the
scarlets and yellows, orange and reds, that are
flaunting themselves in the face of the sun.</p>

<p>To sit out of doors is only possible beneath
the firs and larches, in the green shade by the
wood house, where the sun never penetrates; and
even here it makes one warm to watch the glare
beyond the thicket of trees, the hot air quivering,
nothing but butterflies and dragon flies about,
and nought to break a breathless silence but
the twitter of the tits, grub-hunting in the
larches, and the perpetual hum of uncountable
insects, who seem to find no heat too great.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But presently the shadows of the pines begin
to lengthen, and in the shade thrown by the
larches along the meadow side blackbirds are
seen making short runs along the ground on
foraging expeditions. Chaffinches, tits, linnets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and bullfinches come out from green hiding
places and go down to the birds’ bath to drink.</p>

<p>Longer grow the shadows, the swallows rise
and take high curving sweeps in the upper air—wonderful
little aeronauts whom no man has
trained.</p>

<p>As the sun touches the top of the opposite
hills a breeze wakes up the birch wood, whispering
that the sunset will soon be here, and the
leaves start talking about the stifling heat that
so exhausted them through the day.</p>

<p>The sun drops lower behind the hill; rabbits
peep out from beneath the brambles, then make
for the hummocky field that adjoins my cabbages,
the field where the big oaks stretch wide arms
over soft, green, luscious grass—Offa’s Oaks we
have named these ancient giants, because they
border Offa’s Dyke; and they have so often
described to the more youthful birch trees the
time when they saw Offa, King of Mercia, come
marching past in 765 <small>A.D.</small>, that at length they
have actually come to believe they were alive
and flourishing in his day! We humour their
age by pretending that it was so.</p>

<p>At last the sun disappears, flaming to the
last in crimson and gold, orange and red. The
breeze gets lustier after the sun has gone under,
and a squirrel comes scampering head first down
a tall fir-tree, in search of a delicious toadstool
that he sometimes finds at its base. Pheasants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
strut up out of the coppice, and roam about the
pasture.</p>

<p>Imperceptibly, you know not whence it
comes, there steals over the earth the cool, refreshing
scent of dew-drenched bracken, mingling
with the sweet wistful evening incense of some
late honeysuckle.</p>

<p>And as you watch the fading after-glow of
pink and saffron, sea-green and tawny-rose, you
sense that in some mysterious way the face of
the garden has entirely changed. Gone is the
fire of the scarlet geraniums; lost is the vermilion
of the nasturtiums; even the sunflowers
hang their heads, and the hollyhocks have turned
off their lights. The marigolds have closed their
eyes, and the eschscholtzias have folded up their
brave flowers, the tired little heads bowing over,
thankful for this respite.</p>

<p>Then, as the montbretias toll the Angelus
from crowds of golden throated bells, the evening
primroses, silently, gratefully, open a thousand
blossoms and bathe the garden in a wondrous
gleam.</p>

<p>Such a clear, clean yellow it is; so quiet and
yet so penetrating; it seems in some strange
way to hold the radiance of heaven and focus it
on the sleeping Flower-patch, subduing all that
would strike a glaring note, hiding the ragged
deficiencies of fading leaves and withering seed-pods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>By day one scarcely noticed the straggling
plants at all, save perhaps to remark on their
rather shabby appearance. But now they shine
from terraces and wall-tops; from crannies in
the rough stone steps they send up tall shafts,
bearing aloft their evening lamps; about the
garden beds, among the currant bushes, at the
edge of the gravel walk, between the stones in
the paved path, wherever they can find root-room,
they have taken hold—for they were ever
wanderers, and given to exploring the farthermost
corner of any garden wherein they have
made themselves at home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The last rose-pink flush has faded from the
clouds; not even a sleepy twitter is heard from
bush or bough; the wind soughs softly in the
pine-trees, those harps of endless strings. From
out her hidden stores of abundance, Nature
has given moisture to the grass, refreshment to
the fainting foxglove leaves, and damped the
forest fern. Then, breathing quiet on a weary
world, has bidden it take rest.</p>

<p>Yet all are not asleep. Standing like
sentinels through the darkest hours of night, the
evening primroses, adding scent to scent, flood
the garden from end to end with a veritable
glory of swaying, gleaming moon-gold.</p>

<h2>XVII<br />

<small>The Carillon of the
Wilds</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the host of alluring things that make for
themselves homes on our hillside, one of the
most lovely is the foxglove. Yet there is no
blatancy about its beauty, nor a great blaze of
light as when the ox-eye daisies wave over the
fields in June.</p>

<p>There is something more subtle than even
its colouring that attracts one to this flower, for
there is mind-rest, there is balm for anxious
hearts, there is new hope and new courage, with
whispers of happiness, in the depths of a foxglove
bell.</p>

<p>If you doubt this, go on a foxglove quest;
leave everything bearing the hall-mark of
advanced up-to-dateness far behind you—though
I’ve nothing to say against the train that takes
you away from towns to the place where the
foxgloves grow! Forget all the regulation ways
of enjoying yourself, and search out the haunts
of the carillon of the wilds.</p>

<p>You will find them on the shady sides of the
hedges, their spikes of bells pushing up through
hawthorn and sloe, through the tangle of bramble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and bryony, cleavers and dog rose that scramble
over the pollarded nut-bushes, beeches, elm-stumps,
and ash-boles, amid all the dear delights
that go to make that poem of loveliness—an
English hedgerow.</p>

<p>You will also find them in little hollows and
dells, in small ravines and in craggy places—in
any spot where they can get a little moisture for
the roots and occasional sunshine for the flowers,
with a certain amount of immunity from the
devastating hand of the human marauder. Give
them but a ghost of a chance to seed themselves
(though this is what the greedy flower-gatherer
invariably denies them), and they will spread with
great rapidity, and paint the face of nature with
a rich glowing carmine that almost makes you
hold your breath when first you see the broad
sweeps of colour on certain hillsides in mid-June.</p>

<p>When you have found them, in any of their
haunts, lift one of the bells and look right into
it, delighting in the splashes and markings, the
fine filaments and the silken texture, the pink
and purple and crimson, the dark brown and
white, the poise of the stalk, the droop of the
bells, the balance that the leaf-arrangement gives
to the whole plant, and the many other characteristics
that go to make up one of the most
exquisite of nature’s products.</p>

<p>The trouble is that in sparse soil, or in wind-swept
places, the plant does not grow so tall as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
in a protected and secluded spot. Hence when
we meet it in the open, its bells hang downwards
below the eye-line, and we do not often remember
to stoop and lift one, to see what
message the bee left for us. Perhaps that is one
reason why it seems to me that, while sunflowers
and hollyhocks spend their days in gazing
after grown-ups, foxgloves are for ever nodding
smilingly and encouragingly to little children.</p>

<p>To those who are accustomed to agricultural
scenery, where the landscape shows far expanses
of pasture-land and cornfields, with wide spreading
low-roofed farms clustered around with barns
and ricks, our hills come as a surprise with their
uneven surfaces, and the scarcity of soil in comparison
with the superabundance of rock.</p>

<p>And even taking into consideration all the
cleared spaces and small farms, the outstanding
feature of the country, so far as the eye can see,
is timber. This is a region of woods and
coppices, with springs that bubble up at the
roots of sturdy trees, protected by their thick
leafage from the onslaughts of the sun. This is
a land of dim grey-green mystery, of silences
that make one tread with reverent awe till one
is brought back to earth, by the ring of the
woodman’s axe, the leisurely song of his saw,
and the crish-crash of a tree as it falls.</p>

<p>In the course of time, the woods have to be
cut; some are cut every fourteen years; others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
are left much longer; it all depends on the kind
of tree and the purpose for which it is being
grown.</p>

<p>But though the woods are cut periodically, it
is not so devastating a process as one might
imagine. For one thing, it is clean work; for
another, it is surface work; and then it is all
done in the open air, with hand-tools and no
machinery, and it is carried out on nature’s own
lines. Hence there is no underground disturbance
that would prevent further growth,
and no smoke of power-driven machinery pollutes
the earth and air.</p>

<p>Yet there would be something very pathetic
about the felling of the trees, as you walk over
ground that has been cut, were it not for the
magical display of beauty nature puts forth in
such circumstances, multitudes of flowers springing
into being that otherwise would not have
come to birth.</p>

<p>At first you see but the prostrate trunks of
the trees, with ivy still clinging to the bark;
there they lie, with branches lopped, each surrounded
by piles of small timber cut into regulation
lengths for various commercial purposes;
with “cords” of faggots for firing, and stacks
of stuff for pea sticks and similar purposes.</p>

<p>Yet you are not long wandering over the
newly-cleared slopes before you see things that
were not evident before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>In winter you discover a red-gold carpet—too
golden to be brown, too brown to be red—where
lie the leaves of the beeches that you
never noticed when the trees were standing.</p>

<p>Then, as spring breathes life into the sleeping
earth, the dead leaves stir, silently, mysteriously,
no human ear can detect the rustle, no human
eye can see the movement, yet the leaves lift
and move apart, disclosing the yellow and green,
and silvery-pink of the primrose buds.</p>

<p>Still further the dead leaves lift, and the violets
look out, and then run all over the place. The
wind-flowers push up next, and before you
realize what has happened, the place is literally
dancing with them. Where did they all come
from?</p>

<p>Last spring you went through this very wood
and saw only a few scattered about at wide
distances, where there chanced to be a filter of
light through the dense branches overhead.
Now the place is an open air ball-room of
curtesying sprites.</p>

<p>Such are the wonderful ways of the woods!</p>

<p>In sheltered spots where the cold winds
cannot reach, cushions of wood-sorrel unfurl
their pale-green leaves, and then send up,
cautiously and shyly, the fragile bells that look
as though a breath would blow them away.
The woodruff also sets to work, for there must
be beauty of odour as well as beauty of colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
and form, and something will be needed to take
the place of the violets when they go.</p>

<p>By this time the bluebells are ready to come
out; but there is no shyness about these, sturdy
in their growth, no obstacle seems to hinder
them; up come the green spears, making their
own way through dead leaves and twigs and
moss and acorn cup, through thickets of low-lying
bramble, through carpets of close-growing
ivy; if a dead branch or a tree trunk lies in their
way, they peep out at one side, “Is there a
trifle of daylight here?” And up they come,
carpeting with blue the open spaces between the
huge masses of rock that lie pell-mell about the
surface; while the humble little ground-ivy lays
cool green fingers, and a little later its violet-blue
flowers, over the cream and silver of the
birches, the soft grey of the beeches, and the
rough bark of the oaks, where the felled trunks
lie among the up-springing grass, sensing for the
last time the coming of spring and summer on
the hillside.</p>

<p>Then it is, when the bluebells have turned to
papery seed-pods, and the primroses have paled
away into space, that the foxgloves begin to
shake out their flowers and the hillside glows and
palpitates with colour. They flourish with a
joyous abandon that is positively infectious, and
makes one feel there is still much left to live for.
The way they suddenly appear when the trees are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
down—whole battalions of them—where only a
season before there were regiments of larches, or
thick woods of mixed timber, is really marvellous.
Undoubtedly the ground must be packed with
seed; more than this, there must always be
young seedlings coming up among the undergrowth
or in sheltered crevices where the larch
needles do not penetrate; for no sooner are the
trees cut than foxgloves start to spread their
leaves to the light, and by the following summer,
often before half the timber has been carried,
you find them by the thousand—and that is a
very low estimate—dotted all over the rough
land, and, with a host of ferns, trying to cover
up all that is maimed, and bare, and jagged, to
hide the scars where the mighty have fallen, to
give beauty for ashes in a very literal sense.</p>

<p>Moreover, there seems an almost uncanny
intelligence in the way they adapt themselves to
their environment. You would think they knew
that the winds from the far-off Channel blow
strong at times, across these high open spaces;
for you find that they invariably place themselves
in the shelter of a big boulder, or settle
down in a little hollow with a protecting flank
of rockery, evidently conscious that their tall
stems would be lashed down flat if exposed to
the full force of the wind. Or you find them
growing, it may be, at the foot of a crumbling
gate post, or against an ivy-covered rock, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
rows of them nestling close up to a lichen-covered
stone wall; and in this way their beauty
is enhanced by the background.</p>

<p>And when they find themselves in an uncongenial
setting—springing up in the very centre
of a woodland path perhaps, or out in the open
where the woodmen have been lopping the
branches from a felled tree, and there is much
devastation to be covered over and atoned for—there
the foxglove lays its leaves as flat as
possible against the earth, so as to offer the least
inducement to the passer-by to injure it. And
though it still sends up its flowers as bravely as
it knows how, they are only a foot high, not the
five and six feet of the foxglove in the shelter.
Yet if it be possible, in the least bit possible, it
leans against the pile of faggots, or gently touches
the desolate trunk of what was once a majestic
old tree—and who dare say that the silent companionship
counts for nothing?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I write this, in a year of the Awful War,
there are some who would tell me that foxgloves
will not find the people in food; while others
see no value in the larches apart from their
service as mine-props.</p>

<p>Yet, while I would not under-estimate the
utilitarian worth of crops and timber, the age-old
truth is still insistent: Man cannot live by
bread alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>You may clear from the surface of the land
every plant that is not edible; you may fell
every tree that does not serve for telegraph pole
or pit wood; you may tabulate the food-productive
qualities of the whole earth, and serve it
out in a blue-book as literature for the people;
you may manufacture electricity till there is no
longer any night, and the mysteries of the twilight
and the moonlight and the starlight are lost
to us for ever; you may destroy the birds till
there isn’t one Glad-song left in the caterpillar-riddled
orchards and gardens; you may harness
the rivers and streams for mechanical purposes,
and drown the voices of the weir in the whirr of
wheels, till there isn’t an ounce of energy flowing
to waste throughout the length and breadth of
the country; you may turn all Nature into a
huge commercial enterprise that is the last word
in economics and efficient organization—and
what will be the result?</p>

<p>Machines in place of souls!</p>

<p>Germany strove to subserve everything to
her own materialistic ends, and the price of her
hideous and colossal crime is a world’s agony.</p>

<p>Though this may seem but a parable, to some
the reading will be clear: Where there is no
vision, the people perish.</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
